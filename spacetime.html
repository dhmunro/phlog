  <h2>Connecting place and time</h2>

  <p>Motion defines time.  We have progressed from the spin of the
    earth to the vibration of cesium atoms, but we have always
    measured time by movement.</p>
  <p>We envision motion as a sequence of snapshots: First the runners
    are lined up at the starting line, next all have advanced a few
    yards, and so on; successive snapshots show the relative positions
    changing as some drop back while others move forward, until a
    final snapshot shows their order at the finish line.  Each of
    those snapshots shows where the runners are in space, and each
    such configuration marks an instant of time.  We can make these
    ideas quantitative by measuring positions in each snapshot with a
    ruler, or better yet, by placing a tape measure beside the track
    so it is visible in each frame.  If we also place a clock beside
    the tape measure, we can reduce the race to the succession of
    position and time coordinates - read from tape and clock
    respectively - for every runner.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>Einstein published his special theory of relativity in two papers
    in 1905.  The first, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,"
    suggests a radical physical interpretation - now called spacetime
    - for the Lorentz transformation which was known to preserve the
    structure of Maxwell's equations.  The second, "Does the Inertia
    of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?" introduces his iconic
    equation $E=mc^2,$ which is to Einstein what $F=ma$ is to Newton.
    Astonishingly, the same 1905 volume of Annalen Der Physik contains
    two additional papers by Einstein which set the stage for even
    greater upheavals in physics than the two on special relativity
    (his 1921 Nobel prize is for one of those, not relativity), but
    that is a tale for another time.  Here and now we will explain the
    bare essentials Einstein's theory of special relativity.  Like
    Einstein, we split our explanation in two parts.</p>
  <p>First, we introduce the concept of spacetime coordinates.  The
    centerpiece of special relativity is the relationship between
    coordinate systems built by observers in relative motion
    (hence <em>relativity</em>), called Lorentz transformation.  We
    restrict our discussion to two dimensions - one time and the other
    position along a line - and explain the similarities and
    differences between this spacetime plane and the familiar
    space-space plane of Euclidean geometry.  Einstein derived the
    surprising properties of high speed motion by carefully analyzing
    the question, "What does it mean for two events at different
    places to happen at the same time?"  His answer explains why
    nothing can move faster than the speed of light, by distinguishing
    timelike from spacelike directions in the spacetime plane.</p>
  <p>Second, we consider collisions between particles or "point
    masses" in light of our analysis of high speed motion.  When a
    moving basketball collides with a stationary tennis ball, the
    tennis ball takes off at just under twice the speed of the much
    more massive basketball.  But this Newtonian analysis of the
    collision cannot be correct for very high speed collisions: If a
    proton moving at, say, three quarters the speed of light hits a
    stationary electron head on, the electron cannot fly away at twice
    the speed of the much more massive proton, because, as we found,
    nothing can move so fast.  The resolution of this conundrum is
    $E=mc^2$ - the recognition that energy, in this case kinetic
    energy, has inertia and momentum.</p>
  <p>The abstract logic of these arguments obscures the most important
    fact about Einstein's theory of relativity: Einstein invented
    relativity to explain an experimental fact which subtly disagreed
    with Newton's laws - Newton's concept of absolute time fails to
    explain the results of the Michaelson-Morely experiment.  You
    cannot make sense of high speed motion using Newtonian mechanics;
    it slowly stops working as things move faster and faster.  We are
    talking about <em>very</em> high speeds - earth orbits the sun
    at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">30 km/s</span>, but this is
    ten thousand times slower than light and results in negligible
    errors in Newtonian mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>Special relativity is a shining example of the indispensible
    roles of both theory and experiment in science: You cannot
    interpret what you see without a theory or model, but you cannot
    know what questions to ask - let alone what answers to expect -
    without careful observation and experiment.  Most people associate
    science, especially physics, with theoretical physics.  This is
    natural: Lab courses are adjuncts to lecture courses, where we are
    taught how to think, what to expect, and how to argue.  And yet
    when the going gets tough, experimental science takes over.
    Theory always follows experiment, not the other way around.  It is
    no accident that Newton, author of the foundational laws of
    physics, was also one of the greatest experimental physicists in
    history.</p>
  <p>Special relativity rejects absolute time, the assumption that all
    observers will measure the same time interval between any two
    events.  Newton well knew that his laws of motion are based on the
    existence of absolute time - he says so in the first few pages of
    his Principia.  Einstein pointed out in 1905, 18 years after the
    Michaelson-Morely experiment and 218 years after Principia was
    published, that the simplest way to understand that experiment is
    to reject the concept of absolute time.  The real world does not
    behave that way.  And yet, the only response to an anomalous
    experiment is a new theory, for without a model that does explain
    the new result, we have no way to use our discovery.  So Einstein,
    no experimentalist, and his theory get all the popular credit for
    the advance when in fact experiment always leads the way.
    Einstein was a brilliant theorist, deserving all his personal
    credit, but his authority extends only as far as experiment, not
    theory, dictates.</p>
  <p>The history of relativity reminds us that even the most renowned
    experts are slaves to the theories they have built - Newton,
    Gauss, Lagrange, Hamilton, and Maxwell all understood very well
    that their theories assume the existence of absolute time.  In
    1905 Einstein pointed out that the Michaelson-Morely experiment of
    1887 provides solid evidence against absolute time.  There's no
    way anyone could have guessed that outcome.  Indeed, the whole
    experiment was designed to test a prediction of Maxwell's
    understanding of how light propagates through apparently empty
    space.  For twenty years, eminent scientists such as Poincare
    concocted complicated schemes to salvage absolute time and
    still explain the Michaelson-Morely findings.
  </p>
  <p>Why is the speed of light $c$ special?  Because light is a wave
    that can propagate through a vacuum - completely empty space.
    Other waves require a medium, a material for the wave to vibrate,
    and the wave speed is a property of that material.  For example,
    the compressibility and density of air determine the speed of
    sound.  Maxwell and everyone else before Einstein assumed that
    outer space must not be empty precisely because light crosses it.
    But it is.  Exhaustive efforts to determine the speed of the earth
    through this "luminiferous ether" in the late nineteenth century
    failed; special relativity is how we have come to understand these
    experiments.  Since the medium for light is empty space, the speed
    of light is a property of space itself, the limiting speed between
    any cause and its effects.  Light is just an example of a
    phenomenon which moves through vacuum at the speed limit for cause
    and effect that is built into space and time.</p>

  <h2>Spacetime diagrams</h2>
  <p>We begin with some spacetime jargon.  A point in spacetime is
    called an event (supposing <em>something</em> must be happening
    everywhere all the time).  We will plot time upwards and position
    rightwards, which is the usual convention for a spacetime diagram.
    Any object will have some position at every time, which is a
    (maybe curved) line on our spacetime diagram.  This is called the
    world line of the object.  A stationary object has a straight
    vertical world line, and an object moving at a constant speed has
    a straight inclined world line.  Two objects moving at the same
    speed have parallel world lines; otherwise world lines intersect
    at the event where objects either collide or pass.</p>
  <blockquote>[Drawing with two or three pre-drawn world lines and one
    you draw yourself.  A line below the diagram shows the line in
    space; when you begin to drag your point, the spacetime diagram
    begins to unfold from the bottom, stopping when you
    release.]</blockquote>
  <p>You can add your own world line to this spacetime diagram by
    dragging the round marker on the line below the figure to the left
    or right.  When you press down, the diagram above the line records
    your dragging movements by scrolling upward at a constant rate.
    The square markers move in a predetermined way while you move the
    round marker however you please.  The slower you move your marker,
    the more vertical its world line; faster motion corresponds to a
    more horizontal world line.</p>
  <p>We have simply asserted that we plot time vertically and position
    horizontally.  By this, we mean that we plot the locus of events
    at a fixed position in space as a vertical line, and the locus of
    events at some fixed instant in time as a horizontal line.  What
    constitutes a "fixed position" obviously depends on the state of
    motion of the observer: A moving observer will regard anything
    moving with the same velocity to have a "fixed position" relative
    to themselves.  Thus, our spacetime diagram must always adopt the
    point of view of an observer with some particular state of motion
    which we arbitrarily call "stationary".  In spacetime, the point
    of view of an observer comprises not only their location, but also
    their velocity.</p>

  <h2>Synchronizing clocks relates directions in spacetime</h2>
  <p>Since horizontal lines in our diagram are supposed to represent
    all events which happen simultaneously, we need a procedure for
    synchronizing any pair of stationary clocks (which have vertical
    world lines) in order to know where to plot events occuring at the
    clock positions.  Without moving the clocks, the only way to
    synchronize them is to send a signal from one to the other, say
    from left to right.  By subtracting the signal transit time from
    its arrival time at the right clock, we find the time on the right
    clock corresponding to the departure time of the signal from the
    left clock.  Assuming we can send signals through the same channel
    (wire or fiber optic or just empty space) in both directions at
    the same speed, the one way transit time will be half of the round
    trip travel time.  The left clock, say, can time the round trip
    whether we have synchronized the clocks or not.
  </p>

  <h2>Symmetry between observers relates scales in spacetime</h2>

  <p>In ordinary plane geometry, we begin constructing a system of
    coordinates by selecting an origin and a line we will use as
    reference direction.  Euclid then tells us how to construct
    parallel and perpendicular lines we can use to build a coordinate
    grid.  Parallel lines involve the operation of translation, which
    amounts to shifting our origin point, and which we can imagine in
    the spacetime plane just as easily as in the Euclidean plane.
    However, Euclid's construction of perpendicular lines makes no
    sense in a spacetime plane; we need to invent a new procedure to
    define the analog of perpendicularity in order to construct a
    spacetime coordinate grid.</p>
  <p>The key to creating a coordinate system in the spacetime plane is
    synchronizing two identical clocks which are a substantial
    distance apart.  The next figure shows you one way to do that.
    The gray lines are inclined at the speed of light: A light flash
    traveling to the right will be parallel to the right-sloping
    lines, while a leftward traveling flash will be parallel to the
    left-sloping lines.  Light moves the same speed in either
    direction, so the slopes are equal and opposite.  The parallel
    blue lines are the world lines of two clocks.  A light flash
    begins at the left clock, reflects off the right clock, and
    returns to the left clock; we note start and stop times of this
    round trip on the left clock, and the reflection time on the right
    clock.  To synchronize the clocks, subtract half the round trip
    time (as measured by the left clock) from the reflection time on
    the right clock to find the right clock time simultaneous with the
    start time on the left clock.</p>
  <blockquote>[Gray diagonal grid with adjustable slope in background.
    Two parallel clock world lines in blue, initially vertical.  A
    dark gray flash of light world line starts at left clock, reflects
    from the right and returns to the left.  The left clock world line
    is bold from start to stop, and a gray line runs from the midpoint
    on the left world line to the reflection point on the right, with
    a bold half-length extending backwards to that point.  A blue tick
    marks the start time on the left world line, and a similar blue
    tick sits at an arbitrary point on the right.  You can drag that
    tick to adjust the origin of the right clock; when it reaches the
    base of the bold half-length section, a light blue grid appears,
    with the full unit square bold.  A blue dot at the top of the left
    clock line drags to adjust the velocity of the clocks.  A blue dot
    at the top of the right world line drags to adjust the spacing
    between clocks.  A gray dot at the upper right of the gray grid
    drags to adjust the slope of the speed of light
    grid.]</blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The blue ticks mark the zero time for the left and right
      clocks.  Drag the right tick along its world line until it is
      half the round trip time before the reflection event, which will
      cause a blue grid to appear.  The two tick marks are now
      simultaneous, so the clocks are synchronized, and serve as the
      basis of a spacetime coordinate grid.</li>
    <li>Drag the dot marker at the top of the left clock world line to
      change the slope of the two clock world lines, so they represent
      two clocks moving at a common speed.  The gray world lines of
      light flashes do not change slope, even if their source at the
      left clock is moving.  Repeat the synchronization exercise (1),
      noticing that the slope of lines representing simultaneous events
      has changed along with the clock speed.</li>
    <li>Drag the dot marker at the top of the right clock world line
      to change the spatial separation between the two clocks.  Notice
      that the lines of simultaneity, light the clock world lines, do
      not change slope.  Changing the scale of the coordinate grid
      does not change which events are simultaneous.</li>
    <li>Drag the dot marker at the top right of the gray diagonal
      grid to change the slope corresponding the the speed of light.
      This is a purely cosmetic change to show that our procedure for
      constructing spacetime coordinates does not depend on how we
      plot the diagram or on our choice of units for measuring time
      or space.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The surprise about this synchronization procedure, which amounts
    to nothing more than correcting for the travel time of the
    synchronizing light flashes, is that whether we judge two events
    to be simultaneous depends on our state of motion: After
    synchronizing the two clocks in the figure to reveal the line of
    events simultaneous with zero time, try changing the slope of the
    left world line and watch how the line of simultaneity also
    changes slope.  You will find that the phrase "at the same time as"
    has no absolute meaning for distinct events; simultaneity
    is <em>relative</em> to your state of motion.  Two distinct events
    which you judge simultaneous are not simultaneous from the point
    of view of someone who is moving relative to you.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, notice that as you explore all clock world line
    slopes corresponding to velocities less than the speed of light,
    the line of simultaneity sweeps over all the slopes corresponding
    to velocities greater than the speed of light.  That is, any line
    closer to horizontal than the gray light-diagonals is the line of
    simultaneity for some pair of clocks whose world lines are closer
    to the vertical than the gray diagonals.  We can therefore divide
    directions in spacetime into two categories: Spacelike lines are
    closer to horizontal than the gray grid lines, while timelike
    lines are closer to vertical.  These designations reflect the fact
    that timelike lines are world lines for objects moving slower than
    the speed of light, while spacelike lines are lines of
    simultaneity for some observer moving slower than light.  Every
    straight line in the spacetime plane is either spacelike or
    timelike, except for lines parallel to left and right moving light
    flashes which mark the transition from spacelike to timelike.  The
    Euclidean plane has no analog for this dichotomy between timelike
    and spacelike directions.</p>
  <p>The operation of synchronizing clocks defines a unique spacelike
    direction for any given timelike direction and vice versa.  This
    association between two directions in spacetime is the analog of
    perpendicularity in the Euclidean plane.  Euclid provides methods
    for constructing perpendiculars to any given line in ordinary
    plane geometry; synchronizing clocks using light flashes is a
    method for constructing lines of simultaneity for any given world
    line in spacetime geometry.</p>
  <p>There is no place in this picture for observers moving faster
    than light.  Every direction in the spacetime plane is either the
    direction of time or the direction of position for some
    slower-than-light observer (or the direction of a light flash).
    In fact, our clock synchronization procedure would not work for a
    faster-than-light observer, because a light flash from their
    trailing clock would never reach their leading clock.  We will
    explore later what happens when an observer accelerates forever,
    but it will turn out that their world line never becomes
    spacelike.  There is no such thing as a faster-than-light
    observer.</p>

  <h3>Historical objections</h3>
  <p>Every physicist before Einstein would have rejected our procedure
    for synchronizing clocks.</p>
  <p>Those like Newton who believed light consists of particles would
    have rejected the idea that a light flash emitted from a moving
    source would follow the same trajectory through empty space as a
    flash emitted from a stationary source.  They would insist the
    light particles inherit the velocity of their emitter.  From this
    point of view, our synchronization procedure fails because we
    assume a light flash from a moving clock will propagate along the
    same line through spacetime as a flash from a stationary
    clock.</p>
  <p>Those like Maxwell who believed light is an electromagnetic wave
    would have rejected our correction of the reflection time of the
    synchronizing flash by half the round trip time.  They would
    insist that space is not empty but filled with ether, and that our
    correction only applies when the clocks are at rest relative to
    that ether.  When this ether flows past the clocks, they would
    insist that light travels faster downstream than upstream and the
    proper correction for light travel time must take this directional
    difference into account.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, only very careful experiments with very accurate
    clocks moving at very high speeds can answer these objections,
    which come from the most authoritative sources possible.  There is
    no ether because we find that light always travels the same speed
    through empty space no matter how fast you are moving, and light
    emitted from moving sources travels at the same speed as from
    stationary ones.  More subtly, complicated theories (for example
    that a moving light source drags some ether along with it) are
    unnecessary, because the simple clock synchronization procedure we
    have described here perfectly explains all the experimental
    results.</p>
  <p>Even the most surprising consequences of the fact that light
    travels through empty space at the same speed relative to any
    observer regardless of their motion were experimentally confirmed
    in every detail within a few decades of Einstein's 1905
    publication of his theory of special relativity.  Some
    consequences seem strange because we can have no direct experience
    with things moving anywhere near as fast as a flash of light; to
    our senses, light is present or absent instantaneously.  In the
    previous figure, you can drag the gray lines until both diagonal
    directions collapse into horizontal lines.  That is the limit in
    which all our intuitions about motion were formed: Instead of a
    whole range of distinct spacelike directions, there is only a
    single spacelike direction, a line of constant absolute time.
    Only when you are forced to work in situations where the speed of
    light is not effectively infinite can you understand the
    inadequacy of the concept of absolute time.</p>

  <h2>Proper time and distance</h2>
  <p>Simultaneity, defined by clock synchronization, determines the
    direction of the spatial axis of a spacetime coordinate system,
    given the direction of its time axis.  In Euclidean geometry, this
    is analogous to perpendicularity determining the direction of the
    second axis of a rectangular coordinate system given the direction
    of the first axis.  But direction alone does not specify a
    coordinate rotation - we also need to work out how rotated and
    unrotated coordinates must be related in order to preserve
    distance in the rotated coordinate system.  In the Euclidean
    plane, the Pythagorean theorem provides this relationship.  We
    must discover the analog of the Pythagorean theorem in the
    spacetime plane.</p>
  <p>We begin with the spacetime parallelogram which appears in our
    clock synchronization procedure.  The diagonals of this
    parallelogram are world lines of oppositely directed light
    flashes.  Any such parallelogram is the spacetime analog of a
    square in Euclidean geometry.  Now consider another spacetime
    square with a timelike edge in a different direction,
    corresponding to a moving observer.  How big does this new square
    need to be in order for the moving clocks to measure a timelike
    edge of the same duration as the stationary clocks measure for the
    timelike edge of the first square?</p>

  <p>Our clock synchronization procedure defines a unique spacelike
    direction associated with every timelike direction, namely the
    lines of simultaneity associated with a timelike world line.  This
    association is the spacetime analog of perpendicularity: A
    spacelike line is "perpendicular" to a timelike line when the
    spacelike line is a line of simultaneity for an observer whose
    world line is the timelike line.  The analogy in the Euclidean
    plane is that two lines are perpendicular if aligning the first
    line with the horizontal direction of the graph paper causes the
    second line to be parallel to the vertical direction of the graph
    paper.</p>
  <p>Newton divided the spacetime plane into two regions, past and
    future.  For him, the present had no finite extent - it was just a
    single line of simultaneity separating the half-plane of the past
    from the half-plane of the future.  In the Minkowski spacetime of
    Einstein's theory of relativity, our practical procedure for
    synchronizing clocks shows that the set of all spacelike
    directions fills a finite area of spacetime, just like the past
    future.  The present has become a third region of spacetime.  You
    can watch the present collapse into a single Newtonian line by
    changing the slope of the gray grid in the figure to be nearly
    horizontal, corresponding to a nearly infinite speed of light.
    Newton's conception of spacetime is very nearly correct when the
    adjustment to account for the finite speed of light in our
    synchronization procedure is negligibly small.  Errors appear only
    when material objects are moving at an appreciable fraction of the
    speed of light, or when you need exceedingly accurate results.
    Newtonian mechanics is not so much wrong as an approximation that
    is usually very accurate.</p>
  <p>The spacetime analog of a
    Euclidean square is a parallelogram whose diagonals are parallel
    to light flash world lines, like the bold parallelogram which
    appears when you have synchronized the two clocks.  Tiling
    spacetime with these "square" parallelograms produces a coordinate
    system in the spacetime plane analogous to square-grid graph paper
    in the Euclidean plane.</p>
