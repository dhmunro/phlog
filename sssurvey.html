  <h2>How the Sun Moves</h2>

  <p>The Sun moves through the constellations of fixed stars, making
    one complete trip around the Zodiac every year.  It follows
    exactly the same path through the stars every year with great
    precision.  That path, called the ecliptic, is also very precisely
    a great circle - the Earth-Sun line rotates once per year but
    remains in the plane of the ecliptic.  This motion is not quite
    uniform - the Sun takes 186 days to move from the vernal equinox
    in Pisces to the autumnal equinox in Virgo, but only 179 days to
    complete the cycle, although the two points are exactly 180
    degrees apart in the sky.</p>

  <!--
      Title starts with a background showing 120 degrees ecliptic longitude
      and perhaps +-15 degrees ecliptic latitude - a 4:1 aspect.
      The ecliptic plane should be marked and a low contrast grid.
      Constellations of the Zodiac named, with boundaries (including
      Ophiuchus?)  Possibly the celestial equator should be marked as well.
      Left should be east and right west, as if you are facing south and
      looking up.

      As you scroll, the 1st paragraph slides up and the Sun begins to
      move around the ecliptic.  As it gets within say 10 degrees of
      the left (east) edge, the view should scroll to the next 120
      sector, with the scroll finishing when it is say 10 degrees from
      the right edge.  A date indicator increments as you scroll.

      As you continue to scroll, second paragraph materializes and moves
      upwards.

      Need some way to illustrate variation in rate - perhaps show mean
      Sun line, so you can watch it fall behind and move ahead?  This is
      a bit small, but fairly obvious on a 120 degree sector.  This is
      a good way to go.  Furthermore can build plot of deviation from
      mean Sun (in angle?) versus angle to illustrate that it repeats
      perfectly every sidereal year (365.2566 days).  The sky plot can
      scroll to the top to make room for this plot below.  Continuing to
      scroll allows several years to pass, showing the deviation from
      mean Sun retarce precisely the same curve every year.

      Note that eyes.nasa.gov has a fairly clear display of star fields,
      and the way the Sun is plotted with a gradual halo is good.

      Mean Sun: where Sun would be if it moved at constant angular speed
                around the ecliptic.  Possibly this explanation should
                pop up it you click on "Mean Sun" label.
    -->

  <p>Although the Sun does not move at a constant rate around the
    Zodiac, it speeds up and slows down in exactly the same pattern
    every year, with the same remarkable precision that it exactly
    follows a great circle.  This very strongly suggests that its
    motion in the third dimension - distance from Earth - is also
    repeating exactly each year.  So we might naturally suppose that
    the Sun is orbiting a closed path around the Earth (or vice versa)
    in the ecliptic plane once each year.  If so, how can we work out
    the exact shape of this orbit?</p>

  <h2>How the Planets Move</h2>

  <!--
      As the next section heading scrolls into view, the sky map
      recenters and the planets appear; the calendar resets to
      the original start date.

      A few years go by, scrolling to first follow Venus for a
      couple of orbits, then Mars.  The anti-Sun point is marked.

      When the second paragraph scrolls by, the sky view changes
      the way it scrolls to keep the Sun centered, so you can
      watch Mercury and Venus zig zag.

      When the third paragraph starts, we want to follow Mars.
      Probably the best way to do this is the same scrolling
      technique used to follow the Sun.  The anti-sun point
      needs to be marked on the sky, so you can watch the
      retrograde motion near there.  (With luck, a Jupiter or
      Saturn retrograde will also happen within view.)
    -->

  <p>The five naked-eye planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
    Saturn also move through the constellations of fixed stars.  They
    circle through the same constellations as the Sun, but the planets
    all wander noticeably above and below the ecliptic plane.  Their
    motion around the ecliptic is far more erratic than the Sun as
    well.  Usually the planets move around the Zodiac from west to
    east like the Sun, but sometimes they reverse direction and move
    backwards from east to west - retrograde motion.</p>

  <p>Mercury and Venus slowly overtake the Sun, moving from morning
    side to evening side, then reverse direction and rapidly move back
    from evening to morning side.  This looks very much as if we have
    a nearly edge-on view of two objects circling the Sun at a roughly
    uniform rate, moving around it in the same direction as the Sun
    moves around the Zodiac, but faster.  Mercury stays closer to the
    Sun and moves around it faster than Venus.</p>

  <p>Conversely, the Sun overtakes Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, but they
    go retrograde whenever they are on the opposite side of the sky
    from the Sun, called opposition.  Thus, their motions are also
    connected with the Sun, but not in as obvious a way as the motions
    of Mercury and Venus.  A good way to picture the motion of Mars,
    for example, is to imagine how Earth would appear to move around
    the Zodiac if you were standing on Venus.  You would then be
    looking along the same line as when you look at Venus from Earth,
    but in the opposite direction.  That is, wherever Venus appears
    viewed from Earth, Earth is in the antipodal direction viewed from
    Venus.  If Venus is indeed circling the Sun, it is passing between
    the Sun and Earth on its retrograde crossing.  Thus, viewed from
    Venus, Earth appears to go retrograde whenever it is opposite the
    Sun in the sky.  But this is exactly how Mars moves when viewed
    from Earth!</p>

  <p>The motions of the planets thus suggest that they all circle the
    Sun rather than the Earth, because this would neatly explain why
    their retrograde motion is coupled to the position of the Sun.  If
    so, Mercury would be closest to the Sun and circling fastest, then
    Venus - both moving around orbits smaller than the distance from
    Earth to the Sun.  Meanwhile Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn would be
    circling the Sun at progressively larger distances than Earth and
    with increasingly longer orbital periods.</p>

  <h2>Surveying the First Two Orbits</h2>

  <p>So the motions of the planets would be qualitatively explained if
    we were standing on the third planet from the Sun, orbiting it
    once per year, with planets closer to the Sun orbiting faster and
    planets more distant orbiting slower.  When this is your picture
    of the solar system, it's hard not to ask yourself what it would
    look like if you were riding around on one of the other planets
    instead of Earth.  In fact, you already did this when you imagined
    how Earth would appear to move around the sky if you were on
    Venus.</p>

  <p>The Earth seems to be following a closed path around the Sun (or
    vice versa), speeding up and slowing down in precisely the same
    places and at exactly the same times on each lap.  What if the
    Sun's motion is like that when viewed from <em>any</em> planet,
    not just from Earth?  What if all the planets follow their own
    orbit with this same precise periodicity?  Can we test this
    hypothesis?</p>

  <p>Kepler was the first to realize that if a planet orbits the Sun
    periodically, you can use it as a fixed landmark in the sky by
    comparing observations exactly one period apart.  Astonishingly,
    none of the great astronomers for at least two millenia before him
    realized this relatively simple trick gives you a way to survey
    the detailed three dimensional orbits of the planets.  This is
    partly because very few ancient astronomers pictured a
    heliocentric solar system - and in the minds of Kepler and his
    contemporaries this was the revolutionary idea.  However, as a
    matter of experimental technique, the idea of comparing
    observations exactly one period apart would have provided great
    insight even if you adhered to an epicyclic solar system model.
    In fact, periodicity is the cornerstone of epicycles as well,
    making it all the stranger that no one thought to make a real test
    of periodicity for two thousand years.</p>

  <p>Ancient astronomers measured the periods of the planets relative
    to the Sun quite accurately, since they are just as important for
    an epicycle model as for a heliocentric model.  (They did this by
    noting where conjunctions and oppositions with the Sun occurred on
    the ecliptic over many decades.)  Here are the values (in days)

  <p>As long as a planet orbits the Sun periodically in a closed path,
    the projection of its orbit into the plane of the ecliptic will
    also move periodically around a closed path.  The direction of
    this projected orbital point arond the ecliptic is just the
    ecliptic longitude coordinate of the planet.  Thus, we begin
    by simply ignoring the ecliptic latitude coordinate, and figuring
    out the path traced by the projection of the planet's orbit into
    the ecliptic - a problem of plane geometry.  Once we know the
    distance to this projected point, we can easily calculate the
    actual height above or below the ecliptic from the ecliptic
    longitude we started by ignoring.</p>

  <p>Mars is the best choice for a landmark.  You can accurately
    measure the time when it comes into opposition, that is 180
    degrees from the Sun around the ecliptic.  You do not know the
    distance to Mars at this time, but since you don't know any other
    distance yet, you can (temporarily) take this distance as a unit.
    If you step forward or backward in time by exactly one Mars
    orbital period, Mars will have returned to exactly this position,
    but Earth will not.  Each time Mars returns to this landmark spot,
    you measure its direction around the ecliptic.  You also know the
    direction of the Sun, so you can use the Mars-Sun-Earth triangle
    to compute exactly where the Earth is in the ecliptic plane.  Over
    twenty years, you can triangulate eight or nine points on Earth's
    orbit that are one Mars period apart.</p>

  <p>Now from each one of those eight or nine points on Earth's orbit,
    you can step forward or back in time by one Earth year.  Mars will
    have advanced by exactly one Earth year around its orbit in every
    case, so you have a set of eight or nine dates at which you know
    Mars will be exactly at this second landmark position.  But this
    time, you know exactly where Earth was.  Thus, choosing any pair
    of these dates, you can use the observed directions of Mars to
    solve this Earth-Earth-Mars triangle and figure out the exact
    position of this second point on Mars's orbit.</p>

  <p>Notice that any two of these points fix this second position of
    Mars.  The fact that all the pairs of your eight or nine points
    produce the <em>same</em> position is a spectacular confirmation
    of the hypothesis that both Earth and Mars are moving around the
    Sun in periodic orbits.  Another way to picture this is that when
    you draw the eight or nine lines from the points on Earth's orbit
    in the directions you measured, they all intersect at a common
    point.  You have discovered a very subtle, very precise pattern in
    your twenty years of measurements of Mars meandering around the
    sky.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, even if your estimate of the period of Mars is
    imprecise, you find that but tweaking that period, you can always
    make all the lines intersect at a common point.  So you also have
    found a high precision way to measure the period of Mars.</p>

  <p>By stepping forward and backward by Mars years you can fill in
    more points on Earth's orbit, and by stepping forward and backward
    by Earth years you can fill in more points on Mars's orbit.
    Twenty years of data is enough to work your way entirely around
    both orbits, determining roughly forty points on Mars's orbit and
    twenty points on Earth's orbit.  One final great vindication
    awaits: The forty points on Mars's orbit - each viewed from a half
    dozen different points around Earth's orbit - are still just the
    projections of Mars's position into the ecliptic plane.  When you
    put back all of your observed ecliptic longitudes to find
    distances out of plane, you find that not only do all the
    different measurements at each indivdual point produce the same
    distance above or below the ecliptic, but also all forty points
    lie exactly in a single plane containing the Sun!  Just like
    Earth, Mars orbits the Sun periodically in a plane containing the
    Sun.</p>

  <h2>Determining the Remaining Orbits</h2>

  <p>Kepler's technique for surveying a few dozen points on the orbits
    of Earth and Mars is completely original.  No one had ever done
    anything like it in astronomy.  The ancient technique for modeling
    the motion of planets was to guess a form for their orbits with a
    few free parameters - periods, deferent and epicycle radii, and a
    deferent offset, for example - then adjust those parameters to fit
    your observations.  Guessing a parametrized model and fitting its
    parameters to data is still by far the most common way scientists
    work today.  If you guess a good model, this is a tremendously
    efficient way to generate predictive models, in the sense that you
    need very few observations to pin down your parameters - typically
    about as many as you have free parameters.</p>

  <p>By contrast, Kepler's parameter-free survey knit together
    hundreds of observations to produce just a couple dozen points.
    However, once he had finished he had something no astronomer
    before him ever had: He knew the three dimensional positions of a
    bunch of points around the orbits of both Earth and Mars.  For the
    first time, Kepler had a view of what those orbits look like from
    a viewpoint far above the ecliptic plane.  Armed with this
    picture, he could guess a mathematical form for orbital shapes
    with great confidence, and work out the parameters for the case of
    Earth and Mars with unprecedented precision.  He chose a model
    with six parameters for each orbit (seven if you count a starting
    time): its period, its plane (two parameters), its perihelion and
    aphelion (minimum and maximum distances from the Sun), and the
    angle of its perihelion in its orbital plane.  Kepler's first two
    laws, published in 1609, are his formulation of this model.</p>

  <p>Although the calculations are quite involved, measurements of a
    planet's direction in the sky at only three reasonably spread out
    times suffice to determine Kepler's six (or seven) orbital
    parameters, and hence a predictive model of exactly how it is
    moving through the sky.  This is still how astronomers calculate
    the orbits of comets and asteroids, at least to a first
    approximation.  Kepler was the first to apply his laws in this way
    to determine the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn by
    fitting a few observations of each to his orbital model.  Hence,
    in the event, only the orbits of Earth and Mars were gotten by the
    meticulous and original surveying technique based on the
    periodicity of orbits.  The shapes of the other orbits were found
    using the age-old fitting technique, albeit with a much better
    model.</p>

  <p>After ten years reflection on these results, Kepler published his
    third law of orbital mechanics in 1620.  Unlike the first two, the
    third law connects the orbits of different planets: He noticed
    that the cube of the sum of the aphelion and perihelion distances
    is nearly exactly proportional to the square of the period.  Since
    the period can be calculated from the size of the orbit in this
    way, the third law reduces the number of orbital parameters from
    six to five (or seven to six).</p>

  <h2>Historical Notes</h2>

  <p>Fifty years later, Newton realized that the constant of
    proportionality in Kepler's third law is proportional to the mass
    of the Sun.  Newton reformulated the problem with his universal
    law of gravitation, which unifies planetary motion with the motion
    of ordinary human-scale objects on Earth.  Newton's laws explain
    the small deviations of the planets from Kepler's laws telescopic
    observations had revealed in the intervening decades, as well as
    the detailed motion of the Moon.</p>

  <p>The truly original insight Kepler had was how to exploit the
    periodicity of orbits to use Mars as a surveying landmark for
    mapping the solar system.  This is what broke a two thousand year
    logjam and opened new territory for astronomy, much more than the
    rather irrelevant arguments about whether the Sun or the Earth is
    at the "center".  And while Kepler's three laws are a brilliant
    guess at a parametric form describing his newly surveyed orbits,
    they are not nearly as important or original as his periodic
    surveying technique.  If Kepler's guess hadn't happened to solve
    the simplest approximate form of Newton's equations, perhaps his
    more important surveying technique would be better remembered.</p>
