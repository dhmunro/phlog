  <blockquote>
    I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem
    to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
    myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
    than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
    before me.

  <p>I use the basic principles of math and physics constantly.  Can
    interactive web pages communicate these ideas more effectively
    than the textbooks or lectures I learned from?</p>
  <p>The following pages contain interactive graphics.  I try to make
    each page self-contained, so that in the page source (control-u or
    command-u in many browsers) you can see the svg graphics and
    javascript program you are interacting with, as well as the
    html+css.  If you want to tinker with the source, clone a copy
    from <a href="https://github.com/dhmunro/phlog">github</a>.  If
    you have not found <a href="https://explorabl.es/"><em>Explorable
    Explanations</em></a> yet, try it for some similar
    experiences.</p>

      The Pythagorean Theorem</li>
    <li><a href="coords.html">Rulers and Graph Paper</a>:

    <li><a href="roots.html">Roots of Unity</a>:
      Fractional Powers of Complex Numbers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following pages are non-interactive, because I could not
    think of a helpful way to illustrate them.  Much of science and
    perhaps most of mathematics consists of abstract reasoning, after
    all.  My goal remains to reduce an important subject to its
    clearest, simplest form, making it accessible to the widest
    possible audience.  You must still work these things out
    for yourself in order to fully appreciate them.  Perhaps you can view
    these as suggestions for puzzles that I found highly entertaining and
    profitable.</p>

  <!- Ideas:
Scale and Units -- dimensional analysis, SI definitions
When, Where, and How Fast -- spacetime geometry, E=mc2, gravitational redshift
Wings -- how they work
Pendulum and Rigid Rotator -- doubly periodic, or "the torus and the sphere"
Inside the Fireball -- cosmology minus the GR
Probability and Diffusion -- laws of large numbers
Entropy
