  <blockquote>
    I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem
    to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
    myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
    than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
    before me.

  <p>I use the basic principles of math and physics constantly.  Can
    interactive web pages communicate these ideas more effectively
    than the textbooks or lectures I learned from?</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="prop47.html">Proposition 47</a>:
      The Pythagorean Theorem</li>
    <li><a href="coords.html">Rulers and Graph Paper</a>:
      A Physical Model for Complex Arithmetic</li>
    <li><a href="roots.html">Roots of Unity</a>:
      Fractional Powers of Complex Numbers</li>
    <li><a href="picalc.html">Computing Pi by Hand</a>:
      Euler got 20 digits in an hour.  Can you?  <em>(No graphics.)</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most of these pages contain interactive graphics.  I try to make
    each page self-contained, so that in the page source (control-u or
    command-u in many browsers) you can see the svg graphics and
    javascript program you are interacting with, as well as the
    html+css.  If you want to tinker with the source, clone a copy
    from <a href="https://github.com/dhmunro/phlog">github</a>.  If
    you have not found <a href="https://explorabl.es/"><em>Explorable
    Explanations</em></a> yet, try it for some similar experiences.</p>
