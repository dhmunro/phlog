    I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem
    to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
    myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
    than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
    before me.

  <p>I use well-known principles of math and physics constantly.  Why
    do I accept them?  How can I best explain them to people who do
    not already know them?  Should they be taught in the order I
    learned them?  Can interactive web pages communicate these ideas
    more effectively than the textbooks or lectures I learned from?</p>
