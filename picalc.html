      Computing Pi by Hand</a></h1>

  <h2>Euler's method</h2>
  <p>In the mid-seventeen hundreds, Euler produced a series which sums
    to $\pi$ and used it to compute the first twenty digits.  I
    decided to try the same thing, and managed the feat in about a day
    (spread over parts of three days), including a couple of hours to
    re-derive his formula.  I made a half dozen arithmetic errors
    which I could catch and fix because I memorized thirty five digits
    of $\pi$ years ago.  Euler certainly knew more than twenty digits
    of $\pi$ in advance as well, since Machin had computed $\pi$ in a
    similar way to a hundred digits decades earlier.  On the other
    hand, Euler (or Machin for that matter) was hugely more adept at
    arithmetic than I am, and may well have gotten it right the first
    time.</p>
  <p>The basic idea is to use an infinite series for the arctangent
    function $\tan^{-1}$.  Machin used the Taylor series for arctangent,
    which has derivative

    $$\begin{align*}
    \theta &= \tan^{-1}t \\
    t &= \tan\theta \\
    dt &= \sec^2\theta d\theta = (1 + t^2)d\theta \\
    d\theta/dt &= 1/(1+t^2)
    \end{align*}$$

    Now our goal is to write $\theta$ as a power series in $t$, which we
    will derive in an unusual way to prepare for Euler's series later:

    $$\begin{align*}
    \theta &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n \\
    d\theta/dt &= \sum n a_n t^{n-1} = 1/(1+t^2) \\
    \sum n a_n (t^{n-1} + t^{n+1}) &= 1 \\
    \sum ((n+1)a_{n+1} + (n-1)a_{n-1})t^n &= 1 + \sum_{n\gt0} 0\cdot t^n \\
    a_0 &= 0 \\
    a_1 &= 1 \\
    a_{n+1} &= -(n-1)/(n+1) a_{n-1}
    \end{align*}$$

    Thus $a_n = 0$ for all even $n$, and $a_{n} = (-1)^n/n$ for all
    odd $n$ (because the final recursion for a_{n+1} telescopes).  Thus,
    we arrive at the Taylor series for arctangent:

    $$\tan^{-1}t = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n t^{2n+1}/(2n+1)
                 = t - t^3/3 + t^5/5 - t^7/7 + ...$$

    Now the unit of measure for the angle $\theta$ here is radians, so
    that $\tan^{-1}1 = \pi/4$ is the value for $45^\circ$.  Both the
    Machin and Euler techniques use this fact.  However, the direct
    series you get by plugging $t=1$ into the formula, $$\pi/4 =
    1-1/3+1/5-1/7+...$$ converges so slowly that it is computationally
    worthless (it takes fifty terms to get the first two digits, which
    were known to the ancients).  However, notice that if $t$ were
    much smaller than $1$, the series would converge far more rapidly.
    The smaller $t$, the fewer terms of the series you must sum to get
    its arctangent to any des</p>
  <p>Machin had a very clever idea, which is to use the formula for
    the tangent of the sum of two angles to find a set of smaller
    angles which add up to $45^\circ$.  You can organize this kind of
    calculation most easily using complex arithmetic.  The idea is that
    the argument of a complex number (its angle from the real axis) is
    the arctangent of the ratio of its real and imaginary parts, so
    the argument of $1+it$ is $\tan^{-1}t$.  And multiplying two complex
    numbers adds their arguments, so that:

    $$(1+it)(1+iu) = 1-tu + i(t+u)$$

    implies

    $$\tan^{-1}t + \tan^{-1}u = \tan^{-1}(t+u)/(1-tu)$$

    A second thing that would make base ten arithmetic easier would be
    to make $t$ something you can easily raise to powers.  Ideally,
    you would make $t$ a power of ten.  Unfortunately, multiples of
    $\tan^{-1}0.1$ do not come very close to $45^\circ$.  However, Machin
    noticed that four times $\tan^{-1}0.2$, by accident, is exceedingly
    close to $45^\circ$:

    $$\begin{align*}
    \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{5}+\tan^{-1}\frac{1}{5} &=
       \tan^{-1}\frac{5+5}{25-1} = \tan^{-1}\frac{5}{12} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{5}{12}+\tan^{-1}\frac{5}{12} &=
      \tan^{-1}\frac{60+60}{144-25} = \tan^{-1}\frac{120}{119} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{120}{119}-\tan^{-1}1 &=
      \tan^{-1}\frac{120-119}{120+119} = \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{239} \\
    \frac{\pi}{4} = \tan^{-1}1 &= 4\tan^{-1}\frac{1}{5}-\tan^{-1}\frac{1}{239}
    \end{align*}$$

    The combination of this formula and the Taylor series for
    arctangent is what Machin used to compute $\pi$ to a hundred
    digits.  The slower converging $t=1/5$ series compensates by the
    fact that multiplying by this $t$ in base ten is particularly
    easy.  The faster converging $t=1/239$ series, on the other hand,
    requires a nasty long division by $239^2$ for each term.</p>

  <p>Euler improved on Machin's method by finding a decomposition of
    $\tan^{-1}1$ into two parts for which <em>both</em> values of $t$
    are easy to multiply in base ten.  But first, Euler develops a
    different power series for arctangent, based on the fact that

    $$\sin^2\theta = \tan^2\theta/(1 + \tan^2\theta).$$

    Therefore if we define $x=t^2/(1+t^2)$, we have

    $$\tan^{-1}t = \sin^{-1}x^{1/2}.$$

    The idea is to develop a power series in $x$ instead of in $t$,
    but you can't do that directly because of the singularity of
    $x^{1/2}$ at $x=0$.  However, the derivative

    $$d\theta/dx = \tfrac{1}{2}(x(1-x))^{-1/2}$$

    can be used to cancel the square root singularity at $x=0$ to
    produce a function with a well defined power series:

    $$f(x) = \frac{\sin^{-1}x^{1/2}}{(x(1-x))^{1/2}}
           = \frac{2\theta}{\sin 2\theta} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n x^n$$

    Developing this series by taking successive derivatives of $f$
    would be very messy, but the unusual technique of developing a
    recurrence for the $b_n$ directly, which we used to find the $a_n$
    above, works like a charm:

    $$\begin{align*}
    (x(1-x))^{1/2} f &= \sin^{-1}x^{1/2} \\
    (x(1-x))^{1/2} f' + \tfrac{1}{2}(x(1-x))^{-1/2}(1-2x)f &=
      \tfrac{1}{2}(x(1-x))^{-1/2} \\
    2x(1-x) f' + (1-2x) f &= 1 \\
    (2xf' + f) - 2(x^2 f' + x f) &= 1 \\
    \sum (2n+1)b_n x^n - \sum 2(n+1) b_n x^{n+1} &= 1 \\
    \sum ((2n+1)b_n - 2n b_{n-1}) x^n &= 1 \\
    b_0 &= 1 \\
    b_n &= \frac{2n}{2n+1} b_{n-1}
    \end{align*}$$

    Together with the fact that $(x(1-x))^{1/2} = x/t,$ this
    recurrence produces Euler's series for arctangent:

    $$\tan^{-1}t = \frac{x}{t}\left(1+\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{2\cdot 4}{3\cdot 5}x^2
      + \frac{2\cdot 4\cdot 6}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7}x^3
      + \frac{2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdot 8}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 9}x^4 + ...
    \right)$$

    Like the Taylor series, this series gives a direct formula for $\pi$
    by simply plugging in $t=1$, which is $x=1/2$:

    $$\frac{\pi}{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1\cdot 2}{3\cdot 5} +
      \frac{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7} +
      \frac{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4}{3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 9} + ...$$

    Unlike the Taylor series, this series converges reasonably
    quickly, though not nearly as fast as either of the Machin series.
    But using Machin's decomposition trick, we can do much better.
  </p>
  <p>For small $t$, however, Euler's series in powers of $x$ does not
    converge a lot quicker than the Taylor series in $t$: Although $x
    \sim t^2$ for small $t$, all the powers of $x$ appear in the Euler
    series, whereas the series in $t$ contained only odd powers.
    Instead, the advantage is that Euler was able to find a
    decomposition of $\tan^{-1}1$ into a pair of angles for which $x$,
    rather than $t$, makes <em>both</em> angles easy to work with in
    base ten:

    $$\frac{\pi}{4} =
      \tan^{-1}1 = 5\tan^{-1}\frac{1}{7} + 2\tan^{-1}\frac{3}{79}$$

    The fractions $t=1/7$ and $t=3/79$ would be much worse for
    calculating than Machin's $t=1/5$ and $t=1/239$ if we used the
    series in $t$.  But look at the values of $x$!  They are
    $x=1/50=0.02$ and $x=9/6250=0.00144$, both of which are small
    terminating decimal fractions.  This dramatically simplifies the
    base ten arithmetic if you are doing the calculation by hand.  The
    $1/7$ series drops an extra factor of two per term compared to the
    Machin series, which means you need about 30% fewer terms for the
    same final accuracy.  The $3/79$ term, on the other hand,
    converges far more slowly than Machin's $1/239$, requiring about
    70% more terms for the same accuracy.  But the simplicity of
    computing those terms by hand in base ten more than
    compensates, making Euler's method a less daunting choice for
    computing $\pi$ using pencil and paper.  It is perhaps the easiest
    method for computing $\pi$ by hand ever discovered.</p>
  <p>Notice that each term of the series (either for Euler or Machin)
    is a rational number.  Thus, no matter where you terminate the series,
    your approximate value for $\pi$ is technically a rational number.
    You don't need to extract any square roots.  In fact, you only need
    to divide by small integers, which, by hand at least, is much easier
    than dividing by large integers.</p>
  <p>The Euler series in $x$ can be obtained from the Taylor series in
    an arduous manner by applying a general technique for accelerating
    convergence of alternating series called the Euler transform.  I
    assume Euler himself was studying the Taylor series for arctangent
    when he found the series in $x$, rather than by the much simpler
    derivation I sketched above.  The more interesting question is how
    Euler managed to discover his decompositon formula.</p>
  <p>I can imagine how Machin discovered his $1/5$ plus $1/239$
    formula; he would naturally have looked at fractions with
    simple terminating decimals $1/4$, $1/5$, $1/8$, $1/10$.  He then
    builds multiples using the tangent sum formula, and rather quickly
    notices that four times the angle whose tangent is $1/5$ happens
    to be extraordinarily close to $45^\circ$; the $1/239$ remainder
    then drops out quickly as in the derivation given above.</p>
  <p>Euler's $1/7$ plus $3/79$ formula, on the other hand, is beyond
    measure more difficult to discover.  Five times the $1/7$ angle
    isn't notably close to $45^\circ$, and wouldn't really stand out.
    But the $3/79$ angle also needs to be doubled, which means there's
    no easy way to form the remainder.  I can only imagine that Euler
    experimented with all the multiples of small integer ratios, but
    that seems a collosal undertaking.  Furthermore, it's extremely
    difficult to recognize values of $t$ for which $x$ (not $t$) is a
    nice base ten decimal.  The fact that $1/7$ has the nice $x=1/50$ is
    not too hard to notice; after all, $7^2+1=50$ is responsible for
    the fact that $\sqrt{0.5} \sim 0.7$ which is very close to the
    heart of any arithmetician.  But noticing that $79^2+3^2=6250$ is
    a thousand times $5/8$?  That seems a Ramanujanian feat, and is
    the true genius of the whole work.</p>
  <p>To show how much harder Euler's decomposition is than Machin's,
    here's my work checking that it's true:

    $$\begin{align*}
    \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{7}+\tan^{-1}\frac{1}{7} &=
      \tan^{-1}\frac{7+7}{49-1} = \tan^{-1}\frac{7}{24} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{7}{24}+\tan^{-1}\frac{7}{24} &=
    \tan^{-1}\frac{2\cdot 7 \cdot 24}{24^2-7^2}
      = \tan^{-1}\frac{14\cdot 24}{17\cdot 31} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{14\cdot 24}{17\cdot 31} + \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{7} &= ...
      = \tan^{-1}\frac{2879}{7\cdot 479} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{3}{79}+\tan^{-1}\frac{3}{79} &=
      \tan^{-1}\frac{6\cdot 79}{79^2-3^2}
      = \tan^{-1}\frac{3\cdot 79}{41\cdot 76} \\
    \tan^{-1}\frac{2879}{7\cdot 479} + \tan^{-1}\frac{3\cdot 79}{41\cdot 76} &=
      \tan^{-1}\frac{3\cdot 7\cdot 79\cdot 479 + 41\cdot 76\cdot 2879}
      {7\cdot 41\cdot 76\cdot 479 - 3\cdot 79\cdot 2879} \\
    3\cdot 7\cdot 79\cdot 479 + 41\cdot 76\cdot 2879 &\stackrel{?}{=}
      7\cdot 41\cdot 76\cdot 479 - 3\cdot 79\cdot 2879 \\
    (41\cdot 76 + 3\cdot 79)\cdot 2879 &\stackrel{?}{=}\ 
      (41\cdot 76 - 3\cdot 79)\cdot 7\cdot 479 \\
    3353\cdot 2879 &\stackrel{?}{=}\  2879\cdot 7\cdot 479 \\
    3353 &\stackrel{?}{=}\  7\cdot 479
    \end{align*}$$

    Since the final equality is indeed true, $\pi/4 = 5\tan^{-1}1/7 +
    2\tan^{-1}3/79$, as Euler says.  But I haven't a clue to how he
    discovered this.  However, many
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin-like_formula">more
    such decompositions</a> are known, so it may be that there is some
    systematic way to discover and catalog them of which I am
    <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Machin-LikeFormulas.html">simply
    ignorant</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>The calculation itself</h2>
  <p>The $t=1/7$ series has $x=0.02$ and we need to multiply it by
    $5x/t=0.7$.  The $t=3/79$ series has $x=0.00144$ and we need to
    multiply it by $2x/t=0.07584$:

    $$\frac{\pi}{4} = 0.7\sum b_n (0.02)^n + 0.07584\sum b_n (0.00144)^n$$

    I decided to use the recurrence on $b_n$ to compute successive terms
    in the series:

    $$\begin{align*}
    b_0 &= 1 \\
    b_n x^n &= \frac{2n}{2n+1} x b_{n-1}x^{n-1}
    \end{align*}$$

    Using the recurrence, computing each term requires a simple
    multiply $2nx$ followed by the full precision decimal multiply by
    $b_{n-1}x^{n-1}$, followed by a small integer divide by $2n+1$.
  </p>
  <p>Before starting, we need to decide how many decimal points we
    want in our final result, because we need to cut off the long
    division and multiplication operations for each term somewhere.
    That also determines how many terms of each series we need to
    compute.  With the alternating Taylor series, it is obvious that
    each successive term alternately overshoots or undershoots the
    exact answer, so we simply need to go until the next term is
    smaller than the accuracy we want.  However, the Euler series does
    not alternate, so we need a way to bound the sum of all remaining
    terms.  Fortunately, because the $b_n/b_{n-1}$ approaches $1$ from
    below as $n$ increases, we know that:

    $$\begin{array}{l}
    \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} b_n x^n \lt b_N x^N (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...) \\
    \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} b_n x^n \lt b_N x^N / (1 - x) \\
    \sum_{n=0}^{N} b_n x^n \lt \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n \lt
      \sum_{n=0}^{N} b_n x^n + (b_N x^N) x / (1 - x)
    \end{array}$$

    Hence, after computing the $N$-th term, we can multiply it by
    $x/(1-x)$ to put a limit on the sum of all subsequent terms.
  </p>
  <p>We can also estimate the magnitude of the $n$-th term of the
    sequence without computing it exactly.  I estimated an upper bound
    for $b_6 = 2^{10}/(3\cdot 7\cdot 11\cdot 13) \sim 0.4$ while an
    upper bound for $b_{10} = 2^{18}/(11\cdot 13\cdot 17\cdot 19\cdot
    21) \sim 0.3$.  In other words, assuming $b_n \sim 0.4$ is not
    going to be a huge overestimate for any $n\ge6$ we are likely to
    want to compute.  To get 20 digits of $\pi$ after the decimal
    point, we need the sum of all omitted terms to be less than about
    $3\times 10^{-21}$.  But to get $\pi$ we need to multiply the first series
    by $2.8$ and the second series by roughly $0.32$.  (Note the sum
    $3.12$ is just a bit less than $\pi$!)  Thus the tolerable
    errors in the series themselves are about $10^{-21}$ for the
    $t=1/7$ series, and $t=10^{-20}$ for the $t=3/79$ series.
  </p>
  <p>So how many terms of each will we need?  The sixth term of the
    $t=3/79$ series is roughly $0.4\cdot 0.00144^6$, which is roughly
    $3\times 10^{-18}$.  The sum of all remaining terms is thus
    roughly $4.5\times 10^{-21}$, which is about half our acceptable
    limit.  The tenth term of the $t=1/7$ series is roughly $0.3\cdot
    0.02^{10}$, also about $3\times 10^{-18}$.  The sum of all the
    remaining terms is thus about $6\times 10^{-20}$, which is too
    big.  Even after the eleventh term, the sum of what remains would
    be about $x$ times smaller, or $10^{-21}$, which is right on the
    borderline of our target.  Hence if we want to be absolutely sure
    of 20 places after the decimal point of $\pi$, we need 6 terms of
    the $t=3/79$ series, and 11 or possibly 12 terms of the $t=1/7$
    series.  Since we only need to keep a few significant digits of
    the last couple of terms, it doesn't cost a lot to tack on one
    more.
  </p>
  <p>So here are the results I got by hand (on the second attempt in a
    few cases) for the two series.  I show only the results; the
    actual calculations filled about seven sheets of binder paper.
    For comparison, the algebra to derive all the formulas and error
    estimates filled five sheets.  If you give it a try, you can check
    your results against these to spot and correct your errors.  We
    begin with the $t=3/79$ series:

    $$\begin{align*}
    b_1 x =    2/3  x         &= 0.00096 \\
    b_2 x^2 =  4/5  x b_1 x   &= 0.00000110592 \\
    b_3 x^3 =  6/7  x b_2 x^2 &= 0.0000000013650212571428\ 57 \\
    b_4 x^4 =  8/9  x b_3 x^3 &= 0.0000000000017472272091\ 42 \\
    b_5 x^5 = 10/11 x b_4 x^4 &= 0.0000000000000022872792\ 56 \\
    b_6 x^6 = 12/13 x b_5 x^5 &= 0.0000000000000000030403\ 22 \\
    \sum b_n x^n              &= 1.0009611072867707746717 \\
    b_6 x^6 x/(1-x)           &= 0.0000000000000000000044\ \text{upper}
    \end{align*}$$

    And here is the $t=1/7$ series:
    $$\begin{align*}
    b_1 x =    2/3  x                  &= 0.0133333333333333333333\ 33 \\
    b_2 x^2 =  4/5  x b_1 x            &= 0.0002133333333333333333\ 33 \\
    b_3 x^3 =  6/7  x b_2 x^2          &= 0.0000036571428571428571\ 43 \\
    b_4 x^4 =  8/9  x b_3 x^3          &= 0.0000000650158730158730\ 16 \\
    b_5 x^5 = 10/11 x b_4 x^4          &= 0.0000000011821067821067\ 82 \\
    b_6 x^6 = 12/13 x b_5 x^5          &= 0.0000000000218235098235\ 10 \\

  <p>All that remains is to multiply the $t=3/79$ series by $0.07584$ and
    the $t=1/7$ series by $0.7$ and add them, showing 22 decimal places:

    $$\begin{array}{rl}
    &        0.0759128903766286955511 \\
    &        0.7094852730208196140635 \\
    \pi/4= & 0.7853981633974483096146 \\
    \pi =  & 3.1415926535897932384584
    \end{array}$$

    The upper bounds on the contributions of the remaining terms are
    $1.3\times 10^{-21}$ for the $t=3/79$ part and $3.1\times 10^{-21}$
    for the $t=1/7$ part, for a total of $4.4\times 10^{-21}$, putting
    an upper bound of $3.1415926535897932384638$.  The correct value to
    22 places is $3.1415926535897932384626$, which is indeed in our
    calculated range.  Rounding our result to 20 places gives 20 correct
    decimal places $\pi = 3.14159265358979323846$, using 11 $t=1/7$ terms
    and 6 $t=3/79$ terms, although we need to round up the final digit.

  <p>The diameter of the solar system is about $1.5\times
    10^{10}$&nbsp;km, so our error of $10^{-21}/3$ would produce an
    error in its perimeter of $0.5\times 10^{-11}$&nbsp;km, or
    $5$&nbsp;nm, which is about 50 atoms.  I'm very happy to have
    personally verified the value of $\pi$ to an accuracy far greater
    than any practical need, courtesy of the genius of Euler and the
    inspiration of Machin before him.
