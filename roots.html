  <h2>Powers of complex numbers</h2>
  <p>Raising a number $z$ to the power $p$ means multiplying $z$ by
    itself $p$ times, so multiplying two powers evidently adds the
    powers: $z^p z^q = z^{p+q}.$ This relationship uniquely defines
    the meaning of raising $z$ to the $0$ power or to a negative
    power: We must have $z^0 = 1$ and $z^{-p} = 1/z^p$ in order to
    preserve the rule that multiplying powers adds the powers.  Thus
    we know the meaning of any integer power $p$, positive or
    negative.</p>
  <p>Continuing in this way, raising a power to a power evidently
    multiplies the powers: $(z^p)^q = z^{pq},$ which we naturally hope
    to use to define any rational power by $(z^{p/q})^q = z^p.$ Unlike
    non-positive integer powers, however, this attempt hits a snag,
    which textbooks often gloss over little comment.  When $z$ is a
    real number (on a number line) the snag is subtle: For even
    denominators $q$, the sign of $z^{p/q}$ is ambiguous (there is a
    plus and a minus square root for example), and the definition
    doesn't work at all when $z\lt 0.$ We can sweep away the whole
    problem by simply declaring that both $z$ and all its non-integer
    powers $z^p$ only exist for positive $z$.  This step is imminently
    practical, but not as tidy as we like math to be.</p>
  <p>Arguably, complex numbers are interesting precisely because they
    clean up the meaning of raising a number to a fractional power;
    when $z$ is complex, the restrictions on the values of $z^p$
    disappear.  Because <a href="coords.html">complex
    multiplication</a> rotates coordinates in a plane in addition to
    simply scaling them up and down (like ordinary multiplication), in
    the complex plane multiplication by a negative number becomes
    rotation by $180^\circ$, part of a smooth progression of
    rotations.  However, in the complex plane, the ambiguity of a
    fractional power $z^p$ becomes impossible to sweep under the rug,
    and gives us multiple viable choices for what we mean by $z^p$
    when $p$ is not an integer.  (When $p$ is an integer all
    definitions agree on a unique result.)  Here we embrace the
    ambiguity by showing how a non-standard choice can be useful.</p>

  <p>The modulus of the product of any two complex numbers is the
    product of their moduli, and the argument of their product is the
    sum of their arguments.  Geometrically, this means that when you
    raise a complex number $z$ to successive powers by squaring it,
    cubing it, raising it to the fourth power, and so on, what you are
    doing is constructing a series of triangles the same shape as the
    one formed by the points $0$, $1$, and $z$, stacked onto each
    other as shown in the figure.  The orange dot is $z$, and the blue
    segment goes from $0$ to $1$.  The gray dots are $z^2$, $z^3$,
    $z^4$, $z^5$, and $z^6$.  You can drag the orange point $z$ around
    to observe the pattern its powers make on the plane: An arc that
    spirals outward or inward according to whether $z$ is outside or
    inside the unit circle (of radius one centered at the origin).
    Examine what happens when $z$ lies on the unit circle or on the
    real (horizontal) or imaginary (vertical) axis.</p>
  <p>If the lovely arc of the powers of $z$ strikes your fancy, look
    up "logarithmic spiral" and you will find many people agree.
    We'll learn a lot more about these curves by the end of this page.

  <h2>Fractional powers</h2>
  <p>Let's take a closer look at the case when $z$ lies on the unit
    circle.  All powers of any such $z$ also lie on the unit circle.
    In the figure below, you may select a power $p$ from two to six
    and explore how $z^p$ changes as you move $z$ around the unit
    circle.</p>

  <p>When you drag the orange point $z$ once around the circle, the
    blue point $z^p$ to orbits $p$ times.  Thus there are $p$ values
    of $z$ for which $z^p = 1$, marked by the orange ticks around the
    perimeter of the unit circle.  Since the angles between successive
    powers are equal, these $p$ points are equally spaced around the
    unit circle, forming a regular $p$-gon with one corner at the
    point $1$.  Each of these $p$ points is a $p$-th root of $1$, also
    called a $p$-th root of unity.  We see that the fact that two real
    numbers ($+1$ and $-1$) whose squares are one is a special case of
    the general rule that there are $p$ complex numbers with a $p$-th
    power of one.</p>
  <p>In standard mathematical notation, $1^{1/p} = 1$ for all $p$ --
    the most boring choice is the most convenient and consistent for
    many purposes.  But fractional powers are ambiguous, and in the
    case of roots of one, we can make a far more useful choice: On
    this page, let's write $1^{1/p}$ for the first
    <em>interesting</em> $p$-th root of unity - the nearest to $1$ as
    we go counterclockwise around the unit circle.  The other $p$-th
    roots are then $1^{2/p}$, $1^{3/p}$, $1^{4/p}$, and so on up to
    $1^{p/p} = 1.$ Powers greater than $p$ hop counterclockwise around
    the circle again, looping back to $1$ at every multiple of $p$;
    negative powers loop clockwise.</p>
  <p>Thus by defining $1^{1/p}$, we have in fact defined $1^\alpha$
    for all rational numbers $\alpha=n/p$, and by continuity for all
    real numbers $\alpha$.  Namely, $1^\alpha$ is the complex number
    which lies $\alpha$ counterclockwise revolutions around the unit
    circle starting from the point $1$, including fractions of a
    revolution.  That is, an angle in units of revolutions (often
    called cycles) is a power of $1$ in the complex plane.</p>
  <p>In trigonometry, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a point on the
    unit circle as functions of angle from the $x$-axis are called
    cosine and sine, respectively, so by our definition

    $$1^\alpha = \cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha.$$

    Sine and cosine are available on many calculators and in any math
    library.  However, note that our angle $\alpha$ is in units of
    revolutions, so you will usually need to multiply it by either
    $360$ to convert to degrees or by $2\pi$ to convert to radians
    before invoking a library function.  Before computers, every
    scientist and engineer owned tables of sines (and several other
    functions) covering dozens of pages with numbers; they're
    important but not easy to calculate.  But now we can.</p>

  <h2>Trigonometry, briefly</h2>
  <p>The identity of angles with powers of $1$ makes it easy to derive
    all of the trigonometric identities from complex multiplication.
    The most important are the angle addition formulas, which we now
    recognize as nothing more than complex multiplication:

    $$\begin{align*}
    1^{(\alpha+\beta)} &= 1^\alpha 1^\beta \\
    \cos(\alpha+\beta) + i\sin(\alpha+\beta)
    &= (\cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha)(\cos\beta + i\sin\beta)
    \end{align*}$$
    $$\quad\quad = (\cos\alpha\cos\beta - \sin\alpha\sin\beta)
    + i(\sin\alpha\cos\beta + \cos\alpha\sin\beta)$$

    The real parts are the cosine sum formula; the imaginary parts the
    sine sum formula.  The formulas for the difference of angles
    $\alpha-\beta$ are the same but with the signs of $\sin\beta$
    reversed:

    $$1^{-\beta} = 1/1^\beta = \overline{1^\beta}$$

    where $\overline{z}$ means the complex conjugate of $z,$ that is,
    the number with equal and opposite imaginary part.  Trigonometry
    teachers delight in torturing students with endless variants of
    this single idea, that complex multiplication marches around the
    unit circle.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, if we want to build tables of values of the sine
    function, we need to be able to subdivide angles into smaller
    parts.  To compute smaller angles, we can use the fact that the
    diagonal of the rhombus formed by the points $1^\alpha,$ $0,$ $1,$
    and $1+1^\alpha$ bisects angle $\alpha$.  To translate this
    geometric fact into algebra, first write
    $||z||=\sqrt{\overline{z}z}$ for the modulus of $z.$ Next, notice
    that

    $$1^\alpha||1+1^\alpha||^2 = 1^\alpha(1+1^{-\alpha})(1+1^\alpha) =
    (1+1^\alpha)^2,$$

    which implies

    $$\begin{align*}
    1^{\alpha/2} &= (1+1^\alpha) / ||1 + 1^\alpha|| \\
    \cos(\alpha/2) + i\sin(\alpha/2)
      &= (1+\cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha) / \sqrt{2+2\cos\alpha}.
    \end{align*}$$
  </p>
  <p>This half angle formula would suffice for building sine tables.
    However, if you want a challenge and know a little calculus, work
    out the equations you need to solve in order to subdivide an angle
    into three or five parts, by writing out the binomial expansion of
    $1^{3\alpha}$ and $1^{5\alpha}.$ The imaginary parts produce third
    and fifth degree polynomials, respectively, which you can very
    efficiently solve by Newton iteration (the guess-divide-average
    algorithm in the case of square roots) to get $\sin(\alpha/3)$ or
    $\sin(\alpha/5)$ given only $\sin\alpha$.  Note that if you can
    divide an angle in half and into fifths, you can divide it into
    tenths, which is an interesting capability if you want to build a
    sine table.  Dividing by three comes in handy if you work with
    angles in degrees, minutes, and seconds.  There are also nice
    Newton iterations for versine, $\text{ver }\alpha=1-\cos\alpha$
    for the half-angle or quarter angle, if you want to avoid the
    square root in the non-iterative half-angle formula.  The real
    part of $1^{n\alpha}$ gives a nice iteration for
    $\text{ver}(\alpha/n)$ for even $n$, while the imaginary part
    produces a nice iteration for $\sin(\alpha/n)$ for odd $n$.</p>
  <p>It is impossible to overstate the importance of the relationship
    between the complex powers $1^\alpha$ and the trigonometric
    functions $\cos\alpha$ and $\sin\alpha$.  Working with a power law
    is just far simpler than working with raw sines and cosines.
    Practical fields from signal processing to quantum mechanics rely
    heavily on the fact that the complex roots of unity and their
    powers orbit smoothly around the unit circle.  We have approached
    this relationship from the opposite direction of current
    textbooks, and invented a notation $1^\alpha$ you won't see
    anywhere else.  It's time to close the loop by demonstrating how
    our approach relates to the textbook approach.</p>

  <h2>Analytic continuation</h2>
  <p>We've worked our way from powers which are counting numbers, to
    zero or negative integer powers, to rational powers, until finally
    we have a useful definition for a complex value of $1^x$ for any
    real number $x$.  So now the burning question becomes, how can we
    define $1^z$ for any complex number $z$ in a useful and consistent
    way?  The general method for extending a partially defined
    function to cover the whole complex plane is called analytic
    continuation; it is a cornerstone of the theory of analytic
    functions (smooth functions of a complex number that return a
    value which is also a complex number).</p>
  <p>The simplest case is complex multiplication.  Just as raising to
    a power begins with the idea that a power is repeated
    multiplication, the basic idea behind multiplication is repeated
    addition.  For powers of a number $a$, we decided we wanted to
    preserve the property that $a^xa^y=a^{x+y}.$ For multiplication,
    the property we want to preserve is the distributive law,
    $ax+ay=a(x+y)$, and it leads us through the same progression -
    from counting numbers $x$ being repeated addition of $a$ to
    itself, to multiplying by zero or negative $x$, and finally to
    multiplying by any rational fraction $x$, all defined uniquely by
    the requirement that the distributive law continue to apply.  We
    know how to take a final step in the case of multiplication, which
    takes us to values of $x$ in the complex plane.</p>
  <p>The multiplication rule is to regard the first multiplicand $a$
    as the unit on a new "real" axis, that is, as one edge of a new
    unit square, which may be tilted as well as rescaled (depending on
    the value of $a$).  Having chosen one edge of a new unit square,
    the perpendicular edge is determined, both in direction and length
    In fact, it is $ia$, $90^\circ$ counterclockwise from $a$ and of
    equal length.  Thus, our original idea of multiplication as
    repeated addition led us to understand $ax$ for real $x$ as a
    point on the line containing $a$, and inexorably to $a$ times an
    imaginary number $iy$ as a point on the perpendicular to $a$
    (through the origin).  The mapping from real $x$ to complex $ax$
    covers only one line, and is only part of the full complex mapping
    from $x+iy$ to $a(x+iy)$ that fills the whole plane, defined by
    tiling the plane with unit squares that have $a$ for one edge.</p>
  <p>Return now to the function $1^x$, which maps the real axis onto
    the unit circle periodically, revolving around the circle once
    every time $x$ increases by $1$.  Instead of mapping to a straight
    line, the real axis now maps to a curve, the unit circle.
