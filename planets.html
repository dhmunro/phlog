  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>We remember Johannes Kepler for his three laws of planetary
    motion, but those were just his encore.  The really dazzling show
    was how Kepler applied surveying methods to astronomical data, for
    the first time calculating the relative distances to the planets.
    Astronomers had been studying essentially the same data for at
    least two millennia without figuring out how to compute the orbits
    of the planets in three dimensions.  Little more than a half
    century after Kepler, his laws of planetary motion became the
    cornerstone for Newton's theory of universal gravitation, which
    launched modern physics.  The Copernican revolution in astronomy,
    as completed by Kepler's laws, thereby became the seed for the
    subsequent industrial and scientific revolutions that have
    completely rebuilt human society.</p>
  <p>Specifically, Kepler analyzed the naked-eye observations that
    Tycho Brahe made a few decades before the invention of the
    telescope.  Tycho's data consist of measurements of the positions
    of the Sun and planets relative to the fixed stars.  His
    measurements cover about twenty years with an accuracy of about
    two minutes of arc - that is about a fifteenth the diameter of the
    Sun or moon, or a half millimeter at a distance of a meter.  You
    cannot do any better without a telescope.</p>
  <p>In order to walk through what Kepler did step by step, you
    need to open a second browser tab containing an ephemeris
    of planetary data and a series of graphical calculation tools.
    That tab has very little explanation of how to use the tools there,
    so you will want to switch back and forth between the two tabs,
    reading the explanations here, and actually performing the
    calculations there.  Open the second tab now by
    <a href="planetclock.html" target="_blank">clicking this link</a>,
    then return to this tab for more instructions.</p>
  <p>The sections in this tab (see the left sidebar) correspond to the
    main menu items (under the drop down button on the right side) of
    the second tab.  Each section represents a step that Kepler took
    to understand the motions of the planets.</p>

  <h3>Ecliptic Coordinates</h3>

  <p>Before you can start, you need to understand one of the
    coordinate systems astronomers use to locate the Sun and planets
    in space.  J2000 ecliptic coordinates consist of a latitude and
    longitude like the coordinates used for points on the surface of
    the Earth.  The difference is that ecliptic latitude is the angle
    from the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun instead of the
    Earth's equator.  Ecliptic longitude is the angle around the
    perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane instead of Earth's spin
    axis.  The ecliptic longitude of the Sun tells which constellation
    of the Zodiac it is in - each sign represents 30 degrees of
    ecliptic longitude; people have been using ecliptic coordinates
    since ancient times.  (Conventionally, Aries is 0 to 30 degrees
    ecliptic longitude, Taurus 30 to 60, and so on.)</p>
  <p>The axis of the Earth precesses slowly relative to the fixed
    constellations of the stars, about one degree every 72 years, and
    the plane of the Earth's orbit is also changing, though even more
    slowly.  The "J2000" designation means to use ecliptic coordinates
    as the Earth's spin and orbital planes were at noon universal time
    on January 1, 2000.  Thus, J2000 ecliptic coordinates represent a
    direction in space that is fixed relative to the stars (actually
    relative to a few hundred even more distant quasars).  The J2000
    coordinates of the Sun or a planet describe exactly where it
    appears in the constellations of fixed stars as seen from
    Earth.</p>

  <p>The figures above illustrate the relationship between the "planet
    clock" diagram used in the second tab and the actual geometry of
    the sky.  The globe on the left shows the ecliptic coordinate
    system lines of latutude and longitude in gray.  The Earth is the
    blue dot at the center.  The gray ring at the center of the black
    ribbon is the ecliptic equator; the Sun will always be found on
    this ring.  The parallel gray rings above and below the ecliptic
    equator are ±5° ecliptic longitude (the black ribbon itself
    extends to ±9°).  The "planet clock" diagram twists and flattens
    this black ribbon into the equatorial plane as shown in the planar
    diagram on the right.  Since the planets are always found within
    the black ribbon, their positions can always be plotted in the
    planar diagram.</p>
  <p>The globe on the left also indicates the relationship between the
    ecliptic coordinate system and the equatorial latitude and
    longitude used in terrestrial navigation (as well as in astronomy,
    where they are called declination and right ascension,
    respectively).  The three dark blue lines show the perpendicular
    to the ecliptic plane and the lines through the positions of the
    Sun at the equinoxes and the solstices; the three lines are
    mutually perpendicular.  The light blue circle is the ordinary
    equator (that is, the intersection of Earth's equatorial plane
    with this very large celestial globe).  The gray ecliptic equator
    is tilted about 23.5° from the ordinary equator.  The nearly
    vertical light blue line is the Earth's axis, perpendicular to the
    ordinary equator.  The third light blue line and the dark blue
    line of equinoxes both lie in the plane of the ordinary equator
    and are perpendicular to Earth's axis.  Finally, the tropic and
    arctic circle lines are shown in very faint light blue.  Note that
    the tropic circles are just tangent to the ecliptic equator at the
    solstices, while the ecliptic pole lies on the arctic circle.  The
    north ecliptic pole is about halfway between Polaris and Vega if
    you want to find it in the northern sky.</p>

  <h3>Playing with the planet clock</h3>
  <p>The planet clock reproduces the motion of the Sun and planets
    through the constellations quite accurately for any date from 5000
    years in the past to 1000 years in the future (3000 BCE to 3000
    CE).  Thus, you have at your fingertips a distillation of every
    planetary observation in recorded history up to Tycho, the last
    naked-eye astronomer.  (If you want to see the data Kepler worked
    from, run the clock from about 1575 to 1595.)  This starting point
    completely skips over the enormous amount of labor required to
    reduce raw observations of the sky to a few pairs of ecliptic
    coordinates and a time, but you should spend at least a few
    moments appreciating the skill, effort, and persistence of those
    observers.  Unlike them, you can simply dial in a time and see
    where the all the planets appeared.  To a certain extent, this was
    Kepler's situation as well, since he began with Tycho's data.  The
    challenge you face here is to make sense of what you see.</p>
  <p>The planet clock does remind you of the fundamental problem of
    astronomy: You cannot see the stars or planets in daylight.  In
    fact, it is hard to get good observations within an hour of
    sunrise or sunset, which is very roughly indicated by the sky blue
    sector of the planet clock - any time a planet appears within that
    sector, you will have no accurate data about its position.  The
    Sun itself is the exception to this basic rule, but since the
    stars are never visible at the same time, it is quite difficult to
    accurately measure where the Sun is with respect to the
    constellations.  (The solution requires an accurate clock, another
    facet of the long story of how all the data represented by the
    planet clock were collected.)  Since the Sun moves acrosss the sky
    east to west daily, planets to its east - that is counterclockwise
    on the planet clock - will be visible for only a short time after
    sunset before they set themselves.  Similarly, when a planet is
    just west - clockwise - of the Sun, it will be visible for only a
    short time after it rises before sunrise.</p>
  <p>Let's quickly mention the controls on the planet clock to be sure
    you have discovered them all:
    <ul>
      <li>Drag the Sun to change the time (date).</li>
      <li>Press and hold one of the yellow triangles below the clock
        to move time forward or backward, slowly or quickly depending
        on which triangle.</li>
      <li>Click the year button to jump to an arbitrary year.</li>
      <li>Click a planet or its name in the legend to toggle a radial
        line from the Earth at the center of the clock to that planet.
        This lets you see the angle between the Sun and planet, which
        will be important.</li>
      <li>Click the button at the upper left to show or hide the Moon.
        The motion of the Moon is more complicated than the planets;
        its position shown on the clock is accurate for only a few
        centuries around the present.  Mostly you should leave it
        off.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The first thing you notice is that Venus and Mercury always appear
    near the Sun, alternating between the morning side and the evening
    side.  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, on the other hand loop all the
    way around the sky.  When a planet is in exactly the same
    direction as the Sun we say it is at conjunction.  Notice that we
    can never measure conjunctions accurately.  When a planet is
    exactly opposite the Sun in the sky - when it crosses the faint
    yellow line on the planet clock - we say it is at opposition.
    Venus or Mercury is never at opposition.  Opposition observations
    will be indispensible for working out planetary orbits; since
    ancient times astronomers have taken special care to accurately
    measure the time of opposition.</p>
  <p>Notice the strong asymmetry in the motion of Venus and Mercury:
    it takes far longer for them to move from the morning to the
    evening side of the Sun than to move back from evening to morning.
    When you see their motion on the planet clock, with months of
    actual observations reduced to seconds, this asymmetry is even
    more striking.  You very strongly get the impression that Venus
    and Mercury are moving around the Sun, and that we are viewing
    that circular motion nearly edge on.  The morning-to-evening leg
    of their orbit is when they are chasing the Sun, while the
    evening-to-morning leg is when - from our vantage point - they are
    moving opposite to the Sun.  If their orbits around the Sun are in
    the same direction as the motion of the Sun through the
    constellations (counterclockwise viewed from the north), they must
    be passing behind the Sun going from morning to evening, then in
    front of the Sun going from evening to morning.  The slow
    morning-to-evening crossing is called superior conjunction, while
    the rapid evening-to-morning crossing is called inferior
    conjunction.</p>
  <p>Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn generally move through the
    constellations in the same direction as the Sun - west-to-east -
    but more slowly.  However, as they approach opposition, they
    reverse direction, moving east-to-west for a time near opposition.
    This is called retrograde motion.  Notice that Venus and Mercury
    also move retrograde near inferior conjunction, so all the planets
    have a retrograde portion to their motion.  Perhaps the easiest
    way to visualize why the outer planets go retrograde near
    opposition is to imagine the path Earth would move through the
    stars as viewed from Venus: Since the direction of Earth from
    Venus is exactly the opposite to the direction of Venus from
    Earth, Earth appears to move in exactly the same pattern viewed
    from Venus as we see Venus move from Earth - namely it spends most
    of its time in prograde motion, with a quicker retrograde part.
    But what we see as an inferior conjunction of Venus in the middle
    of the retrograde section would appear as an opposition of Earth
    as seen from Venus.  The retrograde motion of Mars, Jupiter, and
    Saturn near opposition has exactly the same cause.</p>
  <p>If you are studying the motion of one planet, it helps to toggle
    on its radial line (and toggle off all the others).  You can then
    press and hold the "play" triangle to watch the motion.
    Personally, I find the impression that Venus and Mercury are
    moving roughly in a circle about the Sun to be quite strong.  I
    find it much harder to directly see that Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
    are also moving around the Sun, just in a circle larger instead of
    smaller than our distance to the Sun.  For me, seeing those larger
    circles requires some reasoning, like imagining how Earth would
    appear to move from Venus.</p>

<section id="orbit-view">
  <h2>Orbit View</h2>

  <p>After you become familiar with the planetary motions shown on the
    planet clock, advance to the "Orbit View" using the main menu
    button on the right side of the page.  This shows you the final
    result you will be pursuing - this is the answer sheet.  The
    radial line for Mars will automatically turn on initially, but you
    can toggle any of the radial lines using the legend in the middle
    of the planet clock as before.  The orbit view on the right shows
    you a theoretical view from a point beyond the solar system in the
    direction of the north ecliptic pole.  The Orbit View panel has
    some yellow buttons along its top edge: The triangles in the left
    corner zoom in so you can see the orbits of Mercury, Venus, and
    Mars, or out so you can see the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
  <p>You can see that the direction from Earth to any planet and from
    Earth to the Sun in the Orbit View always exactly match the
    directions in the Planet Clock.  Of course, every viable theory of
    planetary motion must satisfy this condition first and foremost.
    You can switch among three models using the button at the upper
    right, labeled "heliocentric", "geocentric", and "epicycles".
    They could have been labeled "Copernican" (or simply "modern"),
    "Tychonic", and "Ptolemaic" after their best known proponents.</p>
  <p>The relative positions of the Earth, Sun, and all the planets are
    identical in all three cases; the only differences are which
    object you imagine to be at the center, and what geometrical lines
    and shapes you imagine describing their positions.  No
    observations of the planets can possibly distinguish among the
    three models, since again, they all produce identical relative
    positions of the planets.  Our modern bias in favor of the
    heliocentric model stems from Newton's theory of universal gravity
    rather than from any astronomical observations.</p>
  <p>The shape of the blue Earth orbit around the Sun in the
    heliocentric model is identical to the shape of the gold orbit of
    the Sun around the Earth in the geocentric and epicycles models,
    except it is rotated 180 degrees (since the direction of the Earth
    from the Sun is 180 degrees from the direction of the Sun from the
    Earth).  The only difference between the geocentric and epicycles
    models is that the large, slow orbits of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
    are centered near the Earth instead of the Sun, while a copy of
    the gold Sun orbit is displaced so it becomes an epicycle whose
    center lies near the planetary orbit with the planet on that
    epicycle.  (Mathematically, the order in which you add the two
    roughly circular motions does not matter.  I have to admit that I
    can more easily visualize an epicyclic motion when the radius of
    the epicycle is smaller than the radius of the main cycle,
    although the extra copies of the Sun's orbit seem very
    strange.)</p>
  <p>The important part of the heliocentric hypothesis has nothing to
    do with whether the Sun is at the center.  You must have noticed
    that the motion of the Sun through the constellations is far, far
    simpler than the motion of any planet.  The important part of the
    hypothesis is that, relative to the Sun, the motion of all the
    planets is just as simple.  Relative to the Sun, there is never
    any retrograde motion.  Most importantly, relative to the Sun, the
    motion of all the planets is periodic, repeating exactly the same
    path every orbit around the Sun.</p>
</section>

<section id="earth-period">
  <h2>Earth Period</h2>
  <p>The point of the Earth Period section is to explore the
    extraordinary accuracy with which the Sun repeats its motion each
    year.  You can use this display to calculate the length of the
    sidereal year to within about one thousandth of a day - a little
    more than a minute - using ten years of measurements of the
    position of the Sun.  A sidereal year is the length of time
    required for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun (or
    vice versa).  Despite what everyone is taught in school, this is
    slightly different than the tropical year we use for our calendar
    (because unlike the sidereal year it tracks the seasons), owing to
    the precession of the equinoxes, as Hipparchus discovered more
    than 2100 years ago.</p>
  <p>When you switch to the Earth Period section, a new day counter
    display appears in the middle of the Planet Clock, plus a Reset
    button.  Clicking the Reset button resets the day count to zero at
    the current date on the clock.  As you move the Sun to change the
    date, the day counter increments and decrements accordingly
    (except jumping using the year button starts over).  When you
    click Reset, the Earth period plot automatically plots the number
    of days elapsed versus the change in ecliptic longitude of the Sun
    measured in revolutions for ten years beginning at the date you
    clicked Reset.  Clicking the yellow zoom buttons in the upper left
    corner zooms in or out on this data.  Dragging the Sun around
    after you have clicked Reset will move the Sun marker on the plot
    to show which point corresponds to which date.</p>
  <p>Each yellow box along the diagonal shows one year or Earth
    period.  One year always represents exactly one revolution, so the
    horizontal dimension of the boxes is fixed.  The vertical
    dimension of the yellow boxes is equal to the number of days per
    sidereal year, which you can adjust using the yellow slider at the
    right.  Your current estimate is displayed above the plot.  The
    yellow line is the diagonal of the boxes.  You find the length of
    the year year by adjusting the number of days until the blue data
    line matches the yellow diagonal as best you can.</p>
  <p>When you zoom in the first time, the ten revolutions are stacked
    on top of one another by sliding the yellow boxes and their
    contents together.  Any error in your estimated period (year)
    shows up as the blue data lines not coninciding from one year to
    the next.  At this magnification, you can adjust the year to
    within a couple of tenths of a day.  But the Sun moves around the
    ecliptic about a degree per day, which means you have only found
    the year to within about a tenth of a degree.  Recall that Tycho's
    naked-eye measurements of the Sun and planets are good to within a
    thirtieth of a degree, which over a ten year period ought to allow
    you to determine the sidereal year to a few thousandths of a
    day.</p>
  <p>To improve your Earth period estimate, click the zoom in button a
    second time.  This does not zoom the horizontal axis any further,
    but instead of plotting the measured number of elapsed days
    vertically, it plots the small difference between the blue data
    and the yellow diagonal line, that is the difference between the
    time it actually requires for the Sun to reach a given ecliptic
    longitude and the time it would reach that longitude if it moved
    at a constant rate.  You can now see that the Sun does not move
    around the ecliptic at a perfectly constant rate: Its true
    position deviates by about four days or 1% of a year from a
    perfectly constant speed - so that the blue data line seems to be
    a straight line at the other two zoom levels.  This view has
    effectively zoomed in by a factor of about 100 from the previous
    vertical scale.  You can see that even these small
    non-uniformities in speed repeat from one year to the next with
    extraordinary precision.  And at this zoom level, you can
    determine the length of the year with an accuracy approaching one
    thousandth of a day.  <em>(This accuracy may be higher than the
    JPL approximate position model supports - actual variations in
    year lengths can be as much as 20 minutes or 0.01 day?  Is this a
    problem with the difference between EM barycenter and Earth
    center?)</em></p>
  <p>Incidentally, the variation in the speed of the Sun around the
    ecliptic is large enough to have been noticed since ancient times.
    For example, the time from the spring equinox to the fall equinox
    is about 5 days longer than the time from the fall equinox back to
    the spring equinox - northern hemisphere summer is a few days
    longer than northern hemisphere winter.</p>
  <p>The most important lesson here is qualitative: The position of
    the Sun among the constellations repeats each year with incredible
    precision.  By naked eye observations it is impossible to detect
    any year-to-year variations at all.  What is this exact
    periodicity telling you?  Although you cannot directly measure the
    distance to the Sun (at least by naked eye observations), it is
    hard to imagine that distance is not also varying periodically
    with comparable precision.  If both distance and direction vary
    periodically, the Sun must be moving around the Earth (or
    vice-versa) on a closed path in three dimensions.  That is, after
    exactly one year, the Earth and Sun will return to exactly the
    same relative positions in three dimensions as they have now.</p>
  <p>The motion of the other planets is clearly not periodic with
    respect to the Earth.  The hypothesis you will test is
    that <em>the motion of every planet is periodic with respect to
    the Sun</em>, repeating the same closed path around the Sun over
    and over.  If true, their motion with resepct to the Earth will be
    a compound of two periodic motions; when the two periods are
    incommensurate this compound motion can result in the aperiodic
    wanderings of the planets you observe.  Historically, this special
    feature of the Sun was conflated with the idea that the Sun was at
    the center while the Earth moves. Logically, whether the Earth or
    Sun or neither is "stationary" is independent of whether the
    planets move in periodic closed orbits around the Sun - and the
    latter is the only hypothesis Kepler actually used to work out all
    the relative positions.</p>
  <p>In this section, you have determined the period of Earth's orbit
    around the Sun.  To test whether the other planets follow simple
    periodic orbits around the Sun, you must somehow determine
    accurate periods for planets other than Earth.  Mars is the
    easiest choice, and on Tycho's advice, Kepler chose to focus on
    Mars.</p>

<section id="mars-period">
  <h2>Mars Period</h2>
  <p>Although you can measure the direction of the Earth-planet line
    (the radial line on the Planet Clock), there is no way to measure
    the direction of the Sun-planet line.  This makes it much harder
    to figure out the period of a planet than it was to figure out the
    period of Earth.  However, there is one situation when
    you <em>do</em> know the direction of the Sun-planet line: when
    the Earth-Sun and Earth-planet lines are co-linear.  Except for
    the non-zero ecliptic latitude of the planet, the Sun, Earth, and
    planet are lined up at conjunctions or oppositions, and since you
    cannot accurately measure exactly when a conjunction occurs, you
    are left with oppositions.</p>
  <p>The fact that the planet does not have zero ecliptic latitude at
    opposition means that the three co-linear points at opposition are
    the Sun, the Earth, and the point on the planet's orbit projected
    into the plane of the ecliptic.  However, this projected point
    clearly moves around the Sun with the same period as the planet
    itself.  Furthermore, if you can find the position of the
    projected point at any time (relative to the position of Earth),
    you can use its measured ecliptic latitude to find its coordinate
    perpendicular to the ecliptic.  So you can ignore the ecliptic
    latitude and consider only the plane geometry problem of figuring
    out the motion of the projection of the planet into the
    ecliptic.</p>
  <p>When you switch to the Mars Period section, you see a display and
    controls very similar to the Earth Period section.  Clicking the
    Reset button now collects and plots twenty years of data for the
    time it takes Mars to reach a given ecliptic longitude.  (Recall
    that Kepler worked with twenty years of Tycho's data.)  These data
    appear as a series of light red S-shaped sections near the
    diagonal of the plot.  The gaps are when Mars is near conjunction
    - too close to the Sun to be seen.  The dark red dots are the
    points at opposition, which lie near the center of each retrograde
    section - the kink in the S-shape when ecliptic longitude is
    decreasing with increasing time.  There is also a light red dot
    which moves as you drag the Sun around the clock to show which
    point on the data curve corresponds to a particular date on the
    clock.</p>
  <p>Once again, you see the yellow boxes and the yellow line along
    their diagonals.  The boxes are exactly one revolution longitude
    in width again, and again you can adjust their height using the
    yellow slider along the right side of the plot.  This time, of
    course, you are adjusting your estimate of the number of days it
    takes Mars to go once around the Sun.  The data is drawn in faint
    red because almost all of it is useless - it tells you only about
    the direction of Mars as seen from Earth, while you want to know
    how long it takes Mars to move around one revolution as seen from
    the Sun.  The ten or eleven dark red dots at the oppositions are
    the only useful data here, because only at those times do you know
    the exact direction of Mars (really its projection) as seen from
    the Sun.  You want to adjust the yellow line to pass through all
    the dark red dots as best you can.</p>
  <p>The second zoom level once again stacks the yellow boxes on top
    of one another, so you can see one hypothesized period of the
    motion of Mars around the Sun.  As expected, the light red data
    lines of ecliptic longitude as viewed from Earth do not come close
    to lining up - the motion of Mars is certainly not periodic when
    viewed from Earth.  The dark red opposition dots have a chance of
    being periodic, but in twenty years you only get to see a single
    hypothesized period, so you cannot really be sure.  However, you
    can get a pretty accurate estimate of what the period of Mars must
    be <em>if</em> its motion around the Sun is indeed periodic.  To
    aid you, a dark red line connecting the oppositions has been added
    to the plot.  This is just an arbitrary smooth curve - in fact a
    cubic spline, although Kepler might have used a French curve if he
    ever plotted his oppositions by hand.  This dark red curve
    represents the ecliptic longitude of Mars as seen from the Sun,
    but again only the only points on the curve you have actually
    measured are the dark red dots.  By lining up the ends of this
    curve (the curve terminates at the first and last oppositions in
    the twenty year data set) you can estimate Mars's period to within
    about one day.</p>
  <p>For the Earth, the deviation of its longitude as a function of
    time from a straight line was very subtle.  For Mars, the
    opposition points very obviously do not lie on a straight line.
    The third zoom level again shows the deviation of from the
    straight yellow line.  (That line has been adjusted to pass
    through the first opposition point so it no longer lies exactly
    along the yellow box diagonals.  It is now only parallel to the
    box diagonal.)  At the third zoom level you can see that Mars must
    speed up and slow down much more than Earth as it orbits - the
    deviation from the uniform rate of the yellow line is over 40
    days.  You can also see that the arbitrary dark red line
    connecting the dots does not line up exactly where it overlaps.
    This is because only the opposition points themselves are real
    data.  The result is that you cannot estimate Mars period nearly
    as accurately as Earth's period from just these opposition data -
    you can only be sure to within about 0.1 day.  This is easily good
    enough for a first cut at Kepler's surveying technique.</p>

<section id="survey-orbits">
  <h2>Survey Orbits</h2>
  <p>You are now set to experience one of the greatest Aha! moments in
    the history of science: Kepler's ingenious technique for surveying
    the solar system.  Ordinary terrestrial surveying relies on fixed
    landmarks, perhaps mountaintops or trees or steeples.  By
    measuring the apparent directions of these landmarks from
    different vantage points, the surveyor can use triangulation to
    locate both these vantage points and the relative positions of the
    landmarks on a map.  Because the Sun and planets are constantly
    moving around, there are no fixed landmarks in the sky, and
    applying surveying techniques to the sky seemed hopeless to all
    the great astronomers and geometers from ancient times until the
    year 1600.</p>
  <p>Kepler's great insight is that the hypothesis planetary motion is
    periodic relative to the Sun provides you with the missing fixed
    landmarks: If the planet - Mars in this case - returns to exactly
    the same place relative to the Sun after one period, you can use
    that point as a fixed landmark.  When you make an observation of
    Mars exactly one or two or any number of periods before or after
    an initial observation, it will have returned to exactly where it
    was for your first observation.  Used in this way, Mars can play
    exactly the same role as the reliable fixed mountaintop or tree or
    steeple for the terrestrial surveyor.  A surveyor needs at least
    two landmarks, but for the astronomer the Sun can play the role of
    that second landmark: The Sun and Mars are your two landmarks, and
    the Earth is your vantage point.</p>
  <p>Notice that you are testing a hypothesis: You merely suspect that
    planets move in periodic orbits with respect to the Sun, and you
    have realized that <em>if</em> this is correct, <em>then</em> you
    would be able to use a planet as a landmark and survey the sky.
    All of the work you are about to do is speculative - it may turn
    out that your observations of the directions of Mars viewed from
    Earth are inconsistent with this hypothesis.  You risk only a few
    minutes to find out because the compute engine behind your browser
    is so powerful; Kepler risked decades of his life to work through
    the surveying calculations required to check the periodic orbit
    hypothesis.</p>

  <section id="select-opposition">
    <h3>Select an opposition</h3>
    <p>You cannot choose an arbitrary point on Mars orbit for your
      landmark.  Only an opposition point can serve as your first
      landmark (or second landmark if the Sun is the first).  So your
      first task is to choose which opposition you will use as your
      reference landmark.  Click on the corresponding yellow circle to
      make your choice.  When you make your selection, the Planet
      Clock on the left side will advance to the opposition you have
      selected.  You can come back later and choose a different one if
      you wish - each opposition will produce a different set of
      points around the orbit you are surveying.</p>
    <p>The right side plot shows the same "overhead" view of the
      ecliptic plane as in the Orbit View section.  Here it has become
      the surveyor's map view.  Once you have selected an opposition,
      a black line appears between the Sun and the position of Mars at
      that opposition.  You know the direction of this line segment,
      but not its length in kilometers.  However, because you
      hypothesize that Mars returns to exactly that point every
      period, you are free to use its length as the unit by which you
      will measure all distances in your map of the ecliptic.</p>
    <p>This map is drawn from a heliocentric perspective with the Sun
      always at the center.  This is the easiest analogy with
      surveying, with the Sun and reference Mars point serving as
      fixed landmarks.  From a geocentric perspective, you have to
      think of the reference Sun-Mars line as a rigid object which is
      moving to different positions while not changing its length or
      orientation, which is not quite the mindset of a surveyor, even
      though the geometry is identical.  Kepler of course worked from
      the heliocentric perspective adopted here.</p>

  <section id="earth-orbit">
    <h3>Survey Earth's orbit</h3>
    <p>When you step forward or back one Mars period, Mars returns to
      the reference point, but Earth moves to a new point.  From each
      of these new vantage points, you can use the measured longitudes
      of the Sun and Mars to triangulate and map the location of your
      vantage point - the Earth.  When you click the yellow -M or +M
      buttons at the lower right, the Planet clock will move to the
      corresponding date one Mars period earlier or later.  Also, the
      Earth-Sun and Earth-Mars lines for that date will be
      highlighted.  The directions of these lines in the right map
      panel exactly match the directions of the Earth-Sun and
      Earth-Mars radial lines in the left clock panel by construction:
      The blue Earth point in the ecliptic map is placed at the unique
      point from which those measured directions pass through the Sun
      and Mars reference points.  The first fruit of your survey is to
      be able to mark these eight or nine points on Earth's orbit -
      you now know exactly where the Earth must have been relative to
      the Sun on those dates, not just its direction.  Notice that you
      know the Earth-Sun distance on those dates measured not in
      kilometers, but in units of the length of the black Sun-Mars
      reference line.</p>
    <p>The ±M buttons will not step beyond the twenty year span you
      specified back in the Mars Period section, restricting you to
      about the same amount of data Kepler worked with.</p>
    <p>As you step around Earth's orbit in Mars period steps, notice
      that one (or rarely two) points are missing roughly opposite to
      your selected reference opposition.  These missing points are so
      close to conjunction that Mars could not be seen from Earth.
      The light blue shaded circle around the sun in the right panel
      roughly subtends the same 15 degrees from Earth's orbit as the
      sky blue sector of the Planet Clock.  If the Earth-Mars line
      intersects this light blue circle you will have no data, so you
      cannot determine where the Earth is on that date.  Note also
      that you cannot determine the position of Earth on the date of
      the reference opposition itself, because triangulation does not
      work when the three points are co-linear or nearly so.</p>
    <p>Finally, notice that the positions of these points on Earth's
      orbit depend on your estimate of the period of Mars.  If your
      Mars period is wrong, Mars will have moved slightly from its
      reference position, in addition to the Earth-Sun and Earth-Mars
      directions changing slightly relative to where they were after a
      true period.  The yellow slider used to adjust your estimated
      Mars period has reappeared on the right side, along with the
      display of your current estimate.  By dragging the slider, you
      see the effect of an error in Mars period on the positions of
      the points on Earth's orbit that you calculate.  An error of
      half a day distorts the orbital points into an obvious
      non-closed spiral.  You need to know the period of Mars quite
      accurately before you can apply Kepler's surveying
      technique.</p>
    <p>You still have not surveyed any new points on Mars orbit.
      Furthermore, all practical surveying requires multiple redundant
      measurements, known as closures, which you use to check and
      reduce the inevitable errors in your angle measurements.  Click
      the yellow next button at the upper right to proceed to that
      final phase of Kepler's surveying program.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="mars-orbit">
    <h3>Survey Mars's orbit</h3>
    <p>You know the period of Earth's orbit as well as the period of
      Mars's orbit.  From every one of the eight or nine points you
      found on Earth's orbit, you can step forward or back one Earth
      period by clicking on the yellow +E or -E buttons at the lower
      left.  The Earth - always your vantage point - returns to
      exactly its previous position, but now Mars advances to a new
      position.  In fact, no matter which date Mars was at its
      reference position, one Earth period after that date it will
      reach exactly the same point in its orbit.  Therefore, by
      stepping an Earth period from all of the points you found where
      Mars was at its reference position, you find over half a dozen
      dates on which Mars was at this new position and Earth was at a
      known point on its orbit.  Again, you can step forward and back
      by Mars years to step through these new dates.  Stepping either
      Earth or Mars periods moves the Planet Clock and highlights the
      Earth-Sun and Earth-Mars lines for that particular date, so you
      can see that the two directions are exactly the same on the
      right map panel as on the left clock panel.</p>
    <p>The intersection of any two of the red Earth-Mars lines
      determines the new position of Mars, but you have many such line
      pairs to choose from.  Stunningly, all the red lines very nearly
      intersect at a single common point!  This is the moment that you
      realize you really are on the right track.  If you move the
      slider at the right to change the estimated Mars period, you can
      see that the lines all intersect at a single common point for
      only one value of Mars's period - if you get the period wrong,
      the lines do not intersect.  If you could zoom in around the
      intersection point, you could more accurately judge the best
      value for the Mars period - the one for which all the red lines
      converge to a single point.  Instead of a zoom capability, this
      map panel provides a statistical summary of how nearly the red
      lines intersect at a single point, which is described below.</p>
    <p>When you step to a new point on Mars's orbit you have not
      visited before, the map panel highlights all the blue points
      on Earth's orbit from which you could observe Mars at that
      position within your twenty year span of data.  Most of these
      match the Earth points at the previous step (since the Earth
      always comes back to the same place after a step of an Earth
      period).  However, if you look closely, you will see that one
      Earth point may disappear - which happens when the step would
      take you out of the twenty year window.  More interestingly, one
      or two Earth points may be added.  New Earth points may appear
      either because at the previous step that point falls outside
      the twenty year data window, or because at the previous step
      that point was too near conjunction for any observation to be
      made.</p>
    <p>When a new point on Earth's orbit has never had its position
      fixed before, it cannot be used to determine the position of the
      new point on Mars's orbit.  Instead, after you use all the other
      Earth points to find the new point on Mars's orbit, you can use
      the observation at the new Earth point to determine its position
      on the map.  Such new points have not only the red Earth-Mars
      line drawn, but also a faint gold Earth-Sun line showing the
      angle used to fix that new Earth point.  This is the same
      procedure you used in the previous step to fix the original set
      of points on Earth's orbit, but using a different point on
      Mars's orbit for your second landmark.</p>
    <p>You can keep adding points indefinitely to the orbits of both
      Mars and Earth by stepping forward and back by Earth and Mars
      periods, respectively, while keeping within the twenty year data
      span.  Here the maximum number of Mars period steps away from
      your selected opposition has been limited to ten, and the number
      of Earth period steps has been limited so that there are always
      at least four points on Earth's orbit for each point on Mars's
      orbit.  The total number of points on Earth's orbit constructed
      here is thus always 21 (the original opposition plus 10 Mars
      period steps in either direction), shown as faint blue dots.
      The total number of points on Mars's orbit is about 40, shown as
      faint red dots.  The total number of observation dates is about
      350, all within the twenty year period you chose back in the
      Mars Period section.</p>
    <p>In lieu of that zoomed view, the map panel displays the angular
      errors among the intersection points in yellow above the current
      Mars period estimate in the upper right corner.  You first need
      to know exactly how the red points on the map were computed.</p>
    <p>Each blue point on Earth's orbit has been computed from a
      single observation date from the direction to the Sun and the
      direction to a previously computed point on Mars's orbit.  This
      procedure is not unique; it is just one choice among many since
      you have observations from that same point on Earth's orbit on
      several other dates separated by Earth period steps.  In the
      case of a new point on Mars's orbit, a more complicated
      procedure is chosen here that treats all of the observations you
      made when Mars was at the new point equally: Each observation is
      the direction of a line from Earth to Mars, and we assume that
      the position of Earth at the time of each observation has been
      previously established.  In general these Earth-Mars lines
      do not all intersect at a single point (as you can see by
      adjusting the estimated Mars period away from its true value).
    <p>If you pick any arbitrary point P, the Earth-P line will lie at
      some angle from your observed Earth-Mars line.  You would like
      to find a single point P for which this angle is zero for every
      one of your observations, but if the Earth-Mars lines do not
      exactly converge to a single point there will be no such P.
      However, you can find a point P which is the best compromise.
      The figure of merit statisticians prefer is that you find the
      point P which minimizes the root mean square angle (that is, the
      square root of the average of the squares) between P and all of
      your observations of Mars at that point in its orbit.  This
      turns out to be easy to compute for any set of two or more lines
      even in three dimensions.  Thus, except for the original
      reference opposition point, all the red points on Mars's orbit
      plotted on this map minimize the sum of squares of the errors in
      angle among all of the observations made of Mars when it was at
      that point (all the different Mars period steps).  This
      calculation has been carried out in three dimensions using both
      the measured ecliptic longitude and latitude of Mars, producing
      not only Mars's position in the ecliptic plane shown in this map
      panel, but also its coordinate out of the plane.</p>
    <p>Since each individual point on Mars's orbit (except the
      reference opposition point) has been computed by minimizing the
      RMS angular error between the computed points and our
      observations, a good way to measure the consistency of the
      entire data set is by computing the residual angular errors of
      all roughly 350 observations that contributed to these 40 points
      on Mars's orbit.  That total RMS error is the yellow number just
      above the current estimated Mars period in the upper right
      corner of the map panel.  The number above that is the largest
      angular error betwen an observed position of Mars and the
      position of the best fit point as plotted.  You can now adjust
      the slider to minimize these errors as best you can.  You will
      find that you can get the RMS error down below 0.01° and the
      maximum error down to about 0.02°.  Recall that Tycho's ecliptic
      longitude data is accurate to about 0.03°, so this is roughly
      the level of accuracy Kepler achieved with his original survey
      of Mars's orbit.</p>
    <p>Although this Survey Orbits section began with your estimate of
      Mars's period from the Mars Period section, your estimate of
      Earth's period from the Earth Period section has been ignored.
      Instead, an Earth period of 365.25636 days has been assumed
      throughout this section.  The rationale is that estimating the
      exact period of Mars from ten or eleven opposition points is far
      less accurate than estimating the period of Earth from ten years
      worth of potentially very finely spaced mesurements.  In
      practice, twenty years of Mars observations really does allow
      you to nail down the period of Mars a lot more accurately than
      just the ten oppositions it provides.</p>

  <h2>Mars Inclination</h2>
  <p>The procedure for computing points on Mars's orbit in the Survey
    Orbits section was to compute the point most consistent with all
    of the sight lines measured from different points on Earth's
    orbit.  This produced not only projected positions in the ecliptic
    plane, but also the best fit positions of Mars in three
    dimensions.  In this section you will look at Mars's orbit out of
    the ecliptic plane.</p>
  <p>We begin with the same "overhead" view of the ecliptic plane of
    the points on Earth's and Mars's orbit you mapped in the Survey
    Orbits section.  Initially, the same Earth-Mars lines are shown as
    you were viewing in the Survey Orbits section.  In this section,
    you can click on any of the red dots on Mars's orbit to show
    the Earth-Mars lines for all the observations that contributed
    to you knowledge of that point on Mars's orbit.  Clicking on the
    same point a second time toggles all the Earth-Mars lines off
    so you can more easily see just the orbit points themselves.</p>
  <p>The yellow dot slider on the bottom edge rotates the ecliptic
    plane.  The yellow dot slider on the right edge tilts your
    viewpoint out of the ecliptic plane; with the yellow dot all the
    way at the bottom, you get the "overhead" view you've seen before,
    while all the way at the top you get an edge-on view of the
    ecliptic plane.  The yellow Reset button at the lower left returns
    you to the intial "overhead" view.  The blue line is the line of
    nodes - the intersection between the ecliptic plane and the plane
    of Mars's orbit.  Toggle off all the Earth-Mars lines and move the
    bottom slider until the blue line is nearly vertical.  Then move
    the right slider all the way to the top and you will see that the
    orbit of Mars is tilted very slightly out of the ecliptic.  You
    can see that all the red points lie in a tilted plane more clearly
    if you use the buttons in the upper left corner to magnify just
    the z-coordinate; the 10x magnification makes the tilt easy to
    see.  Notice that for each point on Mars's orbit, the projected
    point in the ecliptic plane is shown as a light red dot.  The 21
    points on Earth's orbit are shown in light blue; they always lie
    in the ecliptic plane, of course.</p>
  <p>If you turn some Earth-Mars lines back on, you can see that the
    observation lines all converge at the point on Mars's orbit in all
    three dimensions.  That is, these 21 points on Earth's orbit and
    about 40 points on Mars's orbit very accurately explain over 350
    individual observations of Mars and the Sun.  The hypothesis that
    both Mars and Earh move in periodic orbits relative to the Sun is
    spectacularly confirmed.  Given the large amount of redundancy
    among all these measurements, it becomes nearly impossible to
    doubt the truth of this three dimensional map of the positions of
    Mars and Earth.  Kepler's version of this map is the first
    accurate chart of the positions of Earth and Mars.</p>

Idea for deriving Kepler's laws from inverse square law:

1. Angular momentum argument shows omega*r**2 = const
   ==> Equal area law follows from central force.
2. Use radial, angular components of vectors.  Since the force is central,
   acceleration is purely radial.
3. The radial acceleration is normal to the angular component of velocity.
   Compute a velocity in the angular direction w = a/omega with a the
   radial acceleration.  The actual velocity is this plus some other vector.
4. By construction, the w vector remains perpendicular to the radius for
   a short step in time.  At the new position, if both the acceleration a
   and omega are proportional to 1/r**2, then the length of the w vector
   a/omega remains unchanged when you repeat this construction.  Hence,
   the orbit must trace a circle in velocity space.
5. The constant velocity displacement vector is perpendicular to the
   Lenz vector.
