  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Line to Point Formulas</h1>

  <p>Consider the line L through a point $\bv{p}$ (a vector) in a
    direction $\bh{d}$ (a unit vector).  So we start with a line L
    and a point $\bv{x}$ not necessarily on L.</p>

  <p>Let $\bm{Q}$ (a matrix) be the operator that projects vectors
    into the plane perpendicular to $\bh{d}.$  Since $\bh{d}\bh{d}^T$
    (the T superscript is transpose) is the operator that projects
    vectors onto the $\bh{d}$ direction,
    \[\bm{Q} = \bm{1} - \bh{d}\bh{d}^T,\]
    where $\bm{1}$ is the identity matrix.  Note that
    $\bm{Q}^T=\bm{Q}^2=\bm{Q}.$</p>

  <p>Hopefully it is clear that $\bv{u}=\bm{Q}(\bv{x}-\bv{p})$ is the
    vector from the point on L nearest $\bv{x}$ to the point $\bv{x}$
    itself.  The length $u$ of $\bv{u}$ is the impact parameter of L
    relative to $\bv{x}$.</p>

  <p>Consider dithering $\bm{x}$ by some tiny amount $\delta\bv{x}.$
    Then $\delta\bv{u}=\bm{Q}\delta\bv{x},$ and $\delta u^2=
    2\delta \bv{u}^T \bv{u},$
    so that
    \[\delta u^2 = 2\delta\bv{x}^T \bm{Q}(\bv{x}-\bv{p}).\]
    (Because $\bm{Q}^T\bm{Q}=\bm{Q}.$)</p>

  <p>Now suppose there are $N$ lines L$_i$, passing through points
    $\bv{p}_i$ with directions $\bh{d}_i$.  These will have impact
    parameters $u_i$ relative to some point $\bv{x},$ and we can find
    the point $\bv{x}$ which minimizes $\sum_i u_i^2,$ which is in
    some sense the point where the lines most nearly intersect (note
    that the minimum of this sum is zero if the lines really do all
    intersect at a point).  At the minimum,
    \[\delta\sum_i u_i^2 = 2\delta\bv{x}^T \sum_i\bm{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i) = 0,\]
    for every possible displacement $\delta\bv{x},$ so
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bv{p}_i.\]
  </p>

  <p>If you think about what you have done here, this formula is the
    best estimate for the intersection point of a set of lines
    assuming that each line is fuzzy - that is, each line is really a
    cylindrical cloud: Assuming independent cylindrical Gaussian fuzz
    clouds of equal variance around each line, minimizing $\sum_i
    u_i^2$ maximizes the probability that the lines all pass through
    $\bv{x}.$  This would be the case if the errors in the $\bh{d}_i$
    were zero, while the errors in the $\bv{p}_i$ were isotropic and
    equal to a common $\sigma_u.$</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if the errors in the $\bv{p}_i$ are negligible
    compared to the errors in the $\bh{d}_i,$ then you should think of
    each line as a fuzzy cone, tapering to a single point at
    $\bv{p}_i,$ and expanding with a tiny angle $\sigma_\alpha$ equal
    to the error in the direction $\bh{d}_i.$ Let
    $\sigma_i=p_i\sigma_\alpha,$ where $p_i$ is the length of
    $\bv{p}_i$ on the assumption that this is far larger than any of
    the $u_i.$  Then
    \[\chi^2 = \sum_i u_i^2/\sigma_i^2
            = \bigr(\sum_i u_i^2/p_i^2\bigl)/\sigma_\alpha^2\]
    is minus the log of the probability that all the measurements $\bv{d}_i$
    could have been made if the true comman intersection point were $\bv{x}.$
    Minimizing this $\chi^2$ thus gives the least squares best estimate
    of $\bv{x}$ assuming that the $\bv{p}_i$ are exactly known and very
    distant, while the $\bh{d}_i$ have a common angular standard deviation
    of $\sigma_\alpha.$  The formula for $\bv{x}$ is the same as before,
    except that the terms in the sums are weighted by $1/p_i^2,$ the
    squares of the distances to $\bv{p}_i$:
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bm{Q}_i/p_i^2\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bv{p}_i/p_i^2.\]
    This makes a certain amount of sense - if all of the uncertainty is
    in the directions $\bh{d}_i,$ then very distant points $\bv{p}_i$
    should contribute very little to your best guess at $\bv{x}.$</p>

  <p>You can obviously write down many such minimum $\chi^2$ formulas to
    account for anisotropic or individual variances in the $\bv{p}_i$ and
    $\bh{d}_i.$  Also, the $\chi^2$ formalism gives you a standard way to
    write down the resulting uncertainty in $\bv{x}$ if you wish.</p>
