  <h2>Appendix A</h2>

  <p>A central problem of surveying is to determine your position
    vector $\bv{x}$ by measuring the directions $\bh{d}_i$ (unit
    vectors) to $N$ landmarks with known positions $\bv{p}_i$ (vectors).
    Consider the projection $\bv{u}_i$ of the vector from your
    position to landmark $i$ into the plane normal to the measured
    direction
    \[ \bv{u}_i = \bv{Q}_i(\bv{p}_i - \bv{x}), \]
    where
    \[ \bv{Q}_i = \bv{I} - \bh{d}_i\bh{d}_i^T \]
    is the projection operator matrix.  If the directions and
    positions had no errors, then by definition the every
    $\bv{p}_i-\bv{x}$ is parallel to $\bh{d}_i$ and all the
    $\bv{u}_i=0.$</p>

  <p>Since the projection operators $\bv{Q}_i$ map 3D space into a 2D
    plane, if there are $N$ landmarks, there are $2N$ linearly
    independent equations $\bv{u}_i=0$ to solve for the three
    components of $\bv{x}.$ (That is, the system is overdetermined
    when $N\ge 2,$ with $2N-3$ degrees of freedom.)  One way to solve
    for $\bv{x}$ is simply to sum the $N$ vector equations:
    \[ \sum_i\bv{u}_i = \sum_i\bv{Q}_i(\bv{p}_i - \bv{x}) = 0, \]
    or
    \[ \bigl(\sum_i\bv{Q}_i\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bv{Q}_i\bv{p}_i. \]
    As long as two of the $\bh{d}_i$ are not parallel,
    $\sum_i\bv{Q}_i$ will not be a singular matrix, even though every
    individual $\bv{Q}_i$ is singular.  In fact, you can weight the
    terms in $\sum\bv{u}_i$ any way you choose and still get a correct
    equation for $\bv{x},$ as long as all the $\bv{u}_i$ really are
    zero.</p>

  <p>In practice, you know neither the $\bh{d}_i$ nor the $\bv{p}_i$
    with perfect accuracy, so the $\bv{u}_i$ will not be precisely
    zero.  Errors $\delta\bh{d}_i$ and $\delta\bv{p}_i$ cause $\bv{u}_i$
    to have a small non-zero value
    \[ \delta\bv{u}_i = \bv{Q}_i(\delta\bv{p}_i - r_i\delta\bh{d}_i), \]
    where $r_i=|\bv{p}_i-\bv{x}|$ is your distance to the $i$-th
    landmark.  (Geometrically, $r_i\delta\bh{d}_i$ is the apparent
    displacement of the landmark caused by the error in direction.
    Algebraically, you can show that the second term equals
    $\delta\bv{Q}_i(\bv{p}_i-\bv{x})$ to first order.)</p>

  <p>Write $\bv{V}(\bv{z})$ for the covariance matrix of a vector
    $\bv{z},$ that is, the expectation value of the outer product
    of the errors,
    \[ \bv{V}(\bv{z}) = &lt;\delta\bv{z}\delta\bv{z}^T&gt;. \]
    From the formula for $\delta\bv{u}_i,$ you can work out the
    covariance of the apparent non-zero projections $\bv{u}_i$ in
    terms of the covariances of the position and direction errors.
    Assuming these are independent.
    \[ \bv{V}(\bv{u}_i) = \bv{Q}_i
          (\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)+r_i^2\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i))\bv{Q}_i. \]
    Presumably you have at least a rough idea of the position and
    direction measurement errors $\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)$ and
    $\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i).$</p>

  <p>This covariance formula gives you a way to estimate the
    likelihood of observing a non-zero value of $\bv{u}_i.$  Assuming
    normally distributed errors, the log of the probability that
    $\bv{u}_i=\delta\bv{u}_i$ is proportional to minus
    \[ \chi_i^2 = \bv{u}_i^T\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i. \]
    Here $\BL(\bv{z})$ is the inverse of the covariance matrix
    $\bv{V}(\bv{z}),$ or the pseudo-inverse with the same range space
    if $\bv{V}$ is singular.  Assuming the $N$ direction measurements
    have independent errors, minus the log of the probability of
    observing each specific non-zero value of $\bv{u}_i$ is
    proportional to the sum
    \[ \chi^2 = \sum_i\bv{u}_i^T\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i. \]
    Therefore, the $\bv{x}$ which minimizes $\chi^2$ is the most
    likely value to have produced the observed $\bh{d}_i.$</p>

  <p>At minimum $\chi^2,$ the gradient $\nabla_\bv{x}$ is zero:
    \[ \sum_i\bigl(-2\bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i
        + \bv{u}_i^T\nabla_\bv{x}\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i\bigr) = 0 \]
    Since $\BL\bv{V}=I$ (or $\bv{Q}$ if $\bv{V}$ is singular),
    \[ \nabla_\bv{x}\BL\bv{V} + \BL\nabla_\bv{x}\bv{V} = 0, \]
    so that
    \[ \nabla_\bv{x}\BL = -\BL\nabla_\bv{x}\bv{V}\BL. \]
    The only $\bv{x}$ dependence in $\bv{V}(\bv{u}_i)$ comes from
    the $r_i^2$ in the variance caused by direction errors.  Since
    $\nabla_\bv{x}r_i^2=-2(\bv{p}_i-\bv{x}),$
    \[ \bv{u}_i^T\nabla_\bv{x}\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i =
          2\bigl(\bv{u}_i^T\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i)
            \BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i\bigr)(\bv{p}_i-\bv{x}). \]
    Finally, the value of $\bv{x}$ which minimizes $\chi^2$ satisfies
    \[ \bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{p}_i, \]
    where the weight matrices are
    \[ \bv{W}_i = \bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i
          - \bigl(\bv{u}_i^T\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i)
                  \BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i\bigr)\bv{I}. \]
  </p>

  <p>If the errors in direction $\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i)$ are non-zero, then
    $\bv{W}_i$ depends on $\bv{x},$ and this 3x3 system of equations
    must be solved iteratively.  A reasonable first guess is
    to take all $\bv{W}_i=\bv{Q}_i.$  However, if the direction
    errors dominate the position errors, and also the landmarks are
    all very distant, $|\bv{p}_i|\gg|\bv{x}|$, then a better first
    guess is $\bv{W}_i=\bv{Q}_i/|\bv{p}_i|^2.$  For any reasonably
    accurate survey, the second term in the expression for $\bv{W}_i$
    will be very small, since it is quadratic in the residuals
    $\bv{u}_i.$  Therefore, it makes sense to only compute it as a
    final correction once iterations using only the first term have
    converged.</p>

  <p>Once you have solved for $\bv{x},$ how accurate is your solution?
    You minimized $\chi^2$ on the assumption that the probability of
    $\bv{x}$ was proportional to $\exp(-\chi^2/2),$ and you can read
    off the inverse covariance matrix near its peak as
    \[ \sum_i\bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i \approx \sum_i\bv{W}_i. \]
    Since you already need the inverse of this sum to solve for
    $\bv{x},$ you may as well estimate that
    \[ \bv{V}(\bv{x}) = \bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bigr)^{-1}, \]
    is the covariance matrix for your position after solving
    \[ \bv{x} = \bv{V}(\bv{x})\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{p}_i. \]
    Also notice that if your analysis is consistent, then when you
    compute the $\chi^2$ corresponding to this value of $\bv{x},$
    you should expect the result to be of order $2N-3,$ the number
    of degrees of freedom in the system.
  </p>

  <h2>Appendix B</h2>

  <p>If your direction measurements are sufficiently precise compared
    to the errors in the landmark positions, then your measurement of
    your position may, as a side effect, improve how accurately you
    know some of the components of your landmark positions.  By
    extending the $\chi^2$ analysis to allow for variations in the
    landmark positions, you can explore this effect.  How accurate
    must your direction measurements be?  How much will they reduce
    the errors in your knowledge of the landmark positions?</p>

  <p>To carry out this program, introduce vectors $\bv{q}_i,$ which
    are your best estimates of the landmark positions, as opposed to
    the true values $\bv{p}_i.$  Then
    \[ \chi^2 = \sum_i\bigl(\bv{u}_i^T\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{u}_i +
      (\bv{p}_i-\bv{q}_i)^T\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)^{-1}(\bv{p}_i-\bv{q}_i)\bigr). \]
    Now you need to find the minimum $\chi^2$ when both $\bv{x}$ and
    all the $\bv{p}_i$ vary.  Since the new terms do not depend on
    $\bv{x},$ the equation you get by setting $\nabla_\bv{x}\chi^2=0$
    remains unchanged.  However, you have to solve $N$ new equations
    to find the $\bv{p}_i$:
    \[ \bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i(\bv{p}_i-\bv{x})
       + \bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)^{-1}(\bv{p}_i-\bv{q}_i) = 0, \]
    or
    \[ \bigl(\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)^{-1}+\bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i\bigr)
       (\bv{p}_i-\bv{q}_i) =
       - \bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i(\bv{q}_i-\bv{x}). \]
    That is, when you combine your direction measurement with your
    existing knowledge of the landmark positions, your measurements
    are best explained by shifting the landmark positions slightly
    from your original best estimates $\bv{q}_i.$  Together with the
    equation for $\bv{x},$ these form a system of $3N+3$ equations
    in $3N+3$ unknowns.  However, since the equations for $\bv{x}$
    must be solved iteratively, you may as well iterate these $N$
    3x3 systems at the same time, starting with $\bv{p}_i=\bv{q}_i$
    and adjusting each $\bv{p}_i$ separately by solving for the
    corresponding $\bv{p}_i-\bv{q}_i$ after each pass.</p>

  <p>From the $\chi^2$ equation, your new position errors have also
    shifted to have inverse covariance
    \[ \bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)^{-1} + \bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i, \]
    that is, the covariance is shifted to the inverse of the matrix
    on the LHS of the equation for $\bv{p}_i$:
    \[ \bv{V}(\bv{p}_i) \to
       \bigl(\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)^{-1}+\bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i\bigr)^{-1}. \]
  </p>

  <p>Before embarking on this program, you should check whether adding
    $\bv{Q}_i\BL(\bv{u}_i)\bv{Q}_i$ to $\bv{V}(\bv{P}_i)^{-1}$ makes
    any significant difference.  There is no need to adjust any $\bv{p}_i$
    for which the new errors will not differ substantially from the old.
    Recall that
    \[ \BL(\bv{u}_i)=\bigl(\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)+r_i^2\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i)\bigr)^{-1}, \]
    so it will make sense to adjust the $\bv{q}_i$ if and only if
    the covariances $r_i^2\bv{V}(\bh{d}_i)$ caused by direction errors
    begin to become as small as the covariances $\bv{V}(\bv{p}_i)$ due
    to landmark position errors.</p>

  <h2>Gaia DR3 star coordinates</h2>

  <p>Gaia DR3 star coordinates use reference era 2016, which I presume
    means J2000.0 plus 365.25\times;16 = 5844 days, or JD 2457389.0.
    Coordinates are given as right ascension, declination, and
    parallax, with standard deviations for all three, as well as all
    correlation coefficients.  Additional data includes proper motion
    in right ascension and declination, together with standard
    deviations and correlation coefficients with the coordinates.
    Both proper motion and covariances in right ascension are
    presented as angles on the sky in the east-west direction, not as
    raw changes in the right ascension coordinate.  Notice that the
    parallax and proper motion will always be substantially
    correlated, since both are derived from small direction changes
    with time.</p>

<h2>(Second try)</h2>

  <p>How can you determine your own vector position $\bv{x}$ by
    measuring the directions $\bh{d}_i$ (as unit vectors) to $N\ge2$
    landmarks with known vector locations $\bv{p}_i$?  Each direction
    restricts your position to some point on the line L$_i$ passing
    through $\bv{p}_i$ with direction $\bh{d}_i$.  Your position
    $\bv{x}$ is the common intersection point of all the L$_i$.</p>

  <p>Consider the operator $\bv{Q}$ (a 3x3 matrix) which projects
    vectors into a plane perpendicular to a direction $\bh{d}.$ Since
    $\bh{d}^T\bv{p}=\bh{d}\cdot\bv{p}$ is the component of $\bv{p}$
    along $\bh{d},$ the projection is $\bv{Q}\bv{p}=\bv{p} -
    \bh{d}\bh{d}^T\bv{p},$ so that
    \[\bv{Q}=\bv{I} - \bh{d}\bh{d}^T,\]
    where $\bv{I}$ is the 3x3 identity matrix.  Note that $\bv{Q}$
    is symmetric and idempotent (applying it a second time leaves
    a projected vector unchanged), so
    \[\bv{Q}^T=\bv{Q}^2=\bv{Q}.\]
    Also notice that $\bv{Q}$ is a singular matrix, collapsing everything
    into the plane normal to $\bh{d}.$</p>

  <p>Returning to the original problem, $\bv{x}$ satisfies
    \[\bv{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i)=0\]
    for every individual landmark, because $\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i$ is
    parallel to $\bh{d}.$ This amounts to $2N$ independent equations
    for the 3 components of $\bv{x}$ owing to the singularity of each
    $\bv{Q}_i$.  This is an overdetermined system with $2N-3$ extra
    degrees of freedom for $N\ge2$, so there are many ways to solve
    for $\bv{x}.$ One interesting way is to sum linear combinations of
    the $N$ vector equations to get a single 3x3 system:
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{Q}_i\bigr)\bv{x}=\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{Q}_i\bv{p}_i\]
    Here the $\bv{W}_i$ are arbitrary 3x3 weighting matrices - they
    can be anything that doesn't make the matrix on the left side
    singular.  For now notice that you could choose all the $\bv{W}_i$
    to be the identity matrix to solve for $\bv{x}$ if all your
    measurements were perfect.</p>

  <p>In practice, errors in your direction measurements, or in
    the landmark positions, or both, mean that the L$_i$ will not
    quite intersect.  (In 3D this will happen even if you use only two
    landmarks, since the two lines will inevitably be skew.)  The best
    you can do is to choose the point $\bv{x}$ most likely to be the
    intersection of the true, mutually intersecting L$_i$, given the
    errors in directions and positions.  We use a $\chi^2$ analysis
    to find this most likely intersection point in terms of the
    direction and landmark errors.</p>

  <p>When there are errors in $\bv{p}_i$ and $\bh{d}_i$ (hence in
    $\bv{Q}_i$), the $\bv{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i)$ will be
    slightly non-zero.  In general, a vector has an error ellipsoid
    defined by a 3x3 symmetric covariance matrix $\bv{V},$ whose
    eigenvectors are the principal axes of the ellipsoid and
    eigenvalues are the corresponding variances.  The $\chi^2$
    statistic is
    \[\chi^2 = \sum_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i)^T\bv{Q}_i^T
                      \bv{V}_i^{-1}\bv{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i).\]
    As noted above, there are $2N-3$ degrees of freedom in this
    system, so if you make good estimates of the $\bv{V}_i$, you
    expect $\chi^2\approx2N-3.$</p>

  <p>To minimize $\chi^2,$ any small variation $\delta\bv{x}$ leaves
    \[\delta\chi^2 = 2\delta\bv{x}^T
       \sum_i\bv{Q}_i^T\bv{V}_i^{-1}\bv{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i) = 0,\]
    which matches the solution for exact positions
    and directions with weights chosen to be
    \[\bv{W}_i = \bv{Q}_i^T\bv{V}_i^{-1}\bv{Q}_i.\]
    In other words, the weights which minimize $\chi^2$ are simply
    the projection of the inverse covariance matrix $\bv{V}_i^{-1}$
    into the plane normal to $\bh{d}_i.$  Notice that with this
    definition $\bv{W}_i\bv{Q}_i=\bv{W}_i,$ so the 3x3 system for
    $\bv{x}$ becomes simply
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bigr)\bv{x}=\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{p}_i.\]
  </p>

  <p>This $\chi^2$ analysis is based on the idea that the likelihood
    of the measured directions and landmark positions being consistent
    with a true position $\bv{x}$ is proportional to $\exp(-\chi^2/2).$
    But this is Gaussian in $\bv{x}.$  The 3x3 covariance matrix for this
    Gaussian is
    \[\bv{V}_{\!\bv{x}} = \bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bigr)^{-1},\]
    so this is the natural estimate for the error ellipsoid associated
    with the minimum $\chi^2$ solution for $\bv{x}$.</p>

  <p>The final result of the $\chi^2$ analysis is thus that the best
    estimate of your position is
    \[ \bv{x} = \bv{V}_{\!\bv{x}}\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bv{p}_i, \]
    with an error ellipsoid specified by the covariance matrix
    \[\bv{V}_{\!\bv{x}} = \bigl(\sum_i\bv{W}_i\bigr)^{-1},\]
    where the weights are
    \[\bv{W}_i = \bv{Q}_i\bv{V}_i^{-1}\bv{Q}_i,\]
    and the $\bv{V}_i^{-1}$ are the inverse covariance matrices for
    the residuals $\bv{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i)$ estimated from the
    errors in the $\bv{p}_i$ and $\bh{d}_i.$</p>

  <p>The only remaining task is to estimate the $\bv{V}_i^{-1}$ for
    some specific cases.</p>

  <p>If a direction $\bh{d}_i$ is imperfectly known, then $\bv{x}$
    could lie anywhere in a thin cone with its apex at $\bv{p}_i$ and
    its axis along L$_i.$ Assuming a normally distributed angular
    error, this conical error distribution has a half-angle of
    $\sigma_{\eta i},$ the standard deviation of the error in
    direction $\bh{d}_i.$ On the other hand, if the landmark position
    is imperfectly known, then $\bv{x}$ could lie anywhere in a thin
    cylinder around L$_i.$ The radius of this cylindrical error
    distribution is $\sigma_{p i},$ the standard deviation of the
    landmark position $\bv{p}_i.$ Note that if the error in $\bv{p}_i$
    is anisotropic, then this error cylinder has an elliptical cross
    section.  If both direction and position are uncertain, the
    combined error distribution will be a thin hyperboloid of one
    sheet with L$_i$ for its axis.</p>

  <h2>Original sketch</h2>

  <p>Consider the line L through a point $\bv{p}$ (a vector) in a
    direction $\bh{d}$ (a unit vector).  So we start with a line L
    and a point $\bv{x}$ not necessarily on L.</p>

  <p>Let $\bm{Q}$ (a matrix) be the operator that projects vectors
    into the plane perpendicular to $\bh{d}.$  Since $\bh{d}\bh{d}^T$
    (the T superscript is transpose) is the operator that projects
    vectors onto the $\bh{d}$ direction,
    \[\bm{Q} = \bm{1} - \bh{d}\bh{d}^T,\]
    where $\bm{1}$ is the identity matrix.  Note that
    $\bm{Q}^T=\bm{Q}^2=\bm{Q}.$</p>

  <p>Hopefully it is clear that $\bv{u}=\bm{Q}(\bv{x}-\bv{p})$ is the
    vector from the point on L nearest $\bv{x}$ to the point $\bv{x}$
    itself.  The length $u$ of $\bv{u}$ is the impact parameter of L
    relative to $\bv{x}$.</p>

  <p>Consider dithering $\bm{x}$ by some tiny amount $\delta\bv{x}.$
    Then $\delta\bv{u}=\bm{Q}\delta\bv{x},$ and $\delta u^2=
    2\delta \bv{u}^T \bv{u},$
    so that
    \[\delta u^2 = 2\delta\bv{x}^T \bm{Q}(\bv{x}-\bv{p}).\]
    (Because $\bm{Q}^T\bm{Q}=\bm{Q}.$)</p>

  <p>Now suppose there are $N$ lines L$_i$, passing through points
    $\bv{p}_i$ with directions $\bh{d}_i$.  These will have impact
    parameters $u_i$ relative to some point $\bv{x},$ and we can find
    the point $\bv{x}$ which minimizes $\sum_i u_i^2,$ which is in
    some sense the point where the lines most nearly intersect (note
    that the minimum of this sum is zero if the lines really do all
    intersect at a point).  At the minimum,
    \[\delta\sum_i u_i^2 = 2\delta\bv{x}^T \sum_i\bm{Q}_i(\bv{x}-\bv{p}_i) = 0,\]
    for every possible displacement $\delta\bv{x},$ so
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bv{p}_i.\]
  </p>

  <p>If you think about what you have done here, this formula is the
    best estimate for the intersection point of a set of lines
    assuming that each line is fuzzy - that is, each line is really a
    cylindrical cloud: Assuming independent cylindrical Gaussian fuzz
    clouds of equal variance around each line, minimizing $\sum_i
    u_i^2$ maximizes the probability that the lines all pass through
    $\bv{x}.$  This would be the case if the errors in the $\bh{d}_i$
    were zero, while the errors in the $\bv{p}_i$ were isotropic and
    equal to a common $\sigma_u.$</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if the errors in the $\bv{p}_i$ are negligible
    compared to the errors in the $\bh{d}_i,$ then you should think of
    each line as a fuzzy cone, tapering to a single point at
    $\bv{p}_i,$ and expanding with a tiny angle $\sigma_\alpha$ equal
    to the error in the direction $\bh{d}_i.$ Let
    $\sigma_i=p_i\sigma_\alpha,$ where $p_i$ is the length of
    $\bv{p}_i$ on the assumption that this is far larger than any of
    the $u_i.$  Then
    \[\chi^2 = \sum_i u_i^2/\sigma_i^2
            = \bigr(\sum_i u_i^2/p_i^2\bigl)/\sigma_\alpha^2\]
    is minus the log of the probability that all the measurements $\bh{d}_i$
    could have been made if the true comman intersection point were $\bv{x}.$
    Minimizing this $\chi^2$ thus gives the least squares best estimate
    of $\bv{x}$ assuming that the $\bv{p}_i$ are exactly known and very
    distant, while the $\bh{d}_i$ have a common angular standard deviation
    of $\sigma_\alpha.$  The formula for $\bv{x}$ is the same as before,
    except that the terms in the sums are weighted by $1/p_i^2,$ the
    squares of the distances to $\bv{p}_i$:
    \[\bigl(\sum_i\bm{Q}_i/p_i^2\bigr)\bv{x} = \sum_i\bm{Q}_i\bv{p}_i/p_i^2.\]
    This makes a certain amount of sense - if all of the uncertainty is
    in the directions $\bh{d}_i,$ then very distant points $\bv{p}_i$
    should contribute very little to your best guess at $\bv{x}.$</p>

  <p>You can obviously write down many such minimum $\chi^2$ formulas to
    account for anisotropic or individual variances in the $\bv{p}_i$ and
    $\bh{d}_i.$  Also, the $\chi^2$ formalism gives you a standard way to
    write down the resulting uncertainty in $\bv{x}$ if you wish.</p>
