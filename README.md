This is a collection of interactive web pages covering various subjects in
physics and mathematics.  I have been a professional physicist for over four
decades, and I am trying to explain and create demonstrations to answer
questions people have asked me over the years.  Additionally, many of these
topics are things I felt insecure about.  Some "why" questions have no answer
(knowledge, like time, begins somewhere), but most "why" questions in physics
and math do have answers in the form of chains of logic.  What is the shortest
chain to get back to basic assertions?
