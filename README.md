This is a collection of interactive web pages covering various subjects in
physics and mathematics.  I have been a professional physicist for over four
decades; these elementary topics are how I've tried to convince myself of the
truth of things I've been taught.  Today more than ever it is important to
question authority.

Mathematics is the most individualist science in the sense that pure authority
carries no weight at all: Great mathematicians merely tell us where to look;
we must all discover what is there for ourselves.  Anyone who takes the
trouble can check the authorities.  More subtly, however, after checking the
truth for ourselves, we can all aspire to simplify the argument or find
shortcuts so seekers who follow us can reach it more quickly and be able to
get farther than we could.  What I can present is less original than this,
a mere collection of what I find the straightest paths and the most
important points I have read.

Physics is the beginning of the slide toward authoritarianism.  Everyone is
forced to accept results of experiments performed by others, although you are
free to repeat them or to try to explain them in alternate ways.  But when a
teacher tells you that some principle has been tested many times with unvarying
results, you are pretty much forced to take their word for it.  You can check
its consistency with other claims your teachers make, but ultimately authority
decides the question.  In this environment, describing the claims of the
authorities about how the world behaves as concisely and clearly as possible
becomes even more important than in math.  Again, I try to collect the pithiest
claims about the nature of nature I know.

Of course, no community activity can exist without some authority; the
optimistic word would be "guidance".  Which brings us back to seeking the
path.
